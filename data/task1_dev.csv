economic," Resources , such as labor , tools , land , and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply .","0"
economic," 4316 . First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .","1"
economic," ( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . )","0"
economic," 4646 . A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions .","1"
economic," A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .","0"
economic," 4661 . Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination .","1"
economic," Affirmative action , in its limited and not especially controversial form , means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs .","0"
economic," 4679 . Driving a certain car , drinking a particular soda , or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically , if at all .","0"
economic," The government rules on advertising , enforced by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , allow advertising to contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product .","0"
economic," They , however , also demand that if a claim is presented as a fact , it must be true .","0"
economic," 4727 . An intermediary is one who stands between two other parties ; for example , a person who arranges a blind date between two other people is one kind of intermediary .","1"
economic," In financial capital markets , banks are an example of a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .","1"
economic," When a bank serves as a financial intermediary , unlike the situation with a couple on a blind date , the saver and the borrower never meet .","0"
economic," 4318 . A similar pattern often operates within businesses .","0"
economic," In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .","1"
economic," Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .","1"
economic," 4333 . But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated .","0"
economic," Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies , which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government ’s approval .","1"
economic," 4396 . Whatever the firm ’s quantity of production , total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit .","0"
economic," As explored in the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity , fixed costs are often sunk costs that can not be recouped .","0"
economic," In thinking about what to do next , sunk costs should typically be ignored , since this spending has already been made and can not be changed .","0"
economic," 4399 . Many industries experience economies of scale .","0"
economic," Economies of scale refers to the situation where , as the quantity of output goes up , the cost per unit goes down .","1"
economic," This is the idea behind “ warehouse stores ” like Costco or Walmart .","0"
economic," 4618 . Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .","0"
economic," Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .","1"
economic," Income inequality compares the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , comparing the share of income received by the top 10 % to the share of income received by the bottom 10 % .","1"
economic," 4630 . The earned income tax credit ( EITC ) , first passed in 1975 , is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system .","1"
economic," The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low - income groups , and projections for 2013 expected 26 million households to take advantage of it at an estimated cost of $ 50 billion .","0"
economic," 4684 . Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .","1"
economic," Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .","1"
economic," The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people .","0"
economic," 4708 . Another source of financial capital is a bond .","0"
economic," A bond is a financial contract : a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future .","1"
economic," A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .","0"
economic," 4723 . The mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories : deposits in bank accounts ; bonds ; stocks ; money market mutual funds ; stock and bond mutual funds ; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold .","0"
economic," Each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors : ( 1 ) the expected rate of return it will pay ; ( 2 ) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected ; and ( 3 ) the liquidity of the investment , which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service .","0"
economic," We will do this analysis as we discuss each of these investments in the sections below .","0"
economic," 4966 . However , if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago , instead of focusing on one - time extremes , you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time .","0"
economic," A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics .","0"
economic," It is interesting to study extreme situations , like the Great Depression of the 1930s or what many have called the Great Recession of 2008 – 2009 .","0"
economic," If you want to understand the whole picture , however , you need to look at the long term .","0"
economic," 4972 . The population more than tripled in the twentieth century , from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2012 .","0"
economic," The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically .","0"
economic," In 1900 , only about one - eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four - year college degree .","0"
economic," 5062 . Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length .","0"
economic," Remember , monetary policy involves a chain of events : the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy , hold a meeting , and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy .","0"
economic," The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system , changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates .","0"
economic," 5074 . Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term .","0"
economic," Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy , the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .","0"
economic," 5098 . [ link ] also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market .","0"
economic," In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered , in the foreign exchange market , supply and demand typically both move at the same time .","0"
economic," Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers .","0"
economic," 5107 . Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy .","0"
economic," However , a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession , or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation .","0"
economic," 5155 . There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years .","0"
economic," For example , a government may decide that by running large budget deficits , it can make crucial long - term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long - term productivity of a country .","0"
economic," These decisions may work out well or poorly , but they are not always irrational .","0"
economic," 5158 . A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital .","0"
economic," If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .","0"
economic," When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out .","1"
economic," To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .","0"
economic," 5170 . The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse .","0"
economic," Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living , GDP per capita , to quantify this diversity .","0"
economic," You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations .","0"
economic," 5179 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .","0"
economic," The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .","0"
economic," In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates .","0"
economic," With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .","0"
economic," 5191 . However , any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits , along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital , has some reason for concern .","0"
economic," During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s , countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in , saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out .","0"
economic," 5194 . In 1817 , David Ricardo , a businessman , economist , and member of the British Parliament , wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation .","0"
economic," In this treatise , Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners , even those that may be relatively inefficient .","1"
economic," 5221 . High - income countries of the world — primarily the United States , Canada , countries of the European Union , and Japan — subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $ 360 billion per year .","0"
economic," By contrast , the total amount of foreign aid from these same high - income countries to the poor countries of the world is about $ 70 billion per year , or less than 20 % of the farm subsidies .","0"
sociology," 5307 . A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .","1"
sociology," A public , on the other hand , is an unorganized , relatively diffused group of people who share ideas , such as the Libertarian political party .","1"
sociology," While these two types of crowds are similar , they are not the same .","0"
sociology," 5337 . He held that once scholars identified the laws that governed society , sociologists could address problems such as poor education and poverty ( Abercrombie et al . 2000 ) .","0"
sociology," Comte named the scientific study of social patterns positivism .","0"
sociology," He described his philosophy in a series of books called The Course in Positive Philosophy ( 1830–1842 ) and A General View of Positivism ( 1848 ) .","0"
sociology," 5739 . Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them .","0"
sociology," A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born .","1"
sociology," A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage .","1"
sociology," 5745 . Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time .","1"
sociology," The reverse , when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time , is called polyandry .","1"
sociology," It is far less common and only occurs in about 1 percent of the world ’s cultures ( Altman and Ginat 1996 ) .","0"
sociology," 5748 . This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent .","0"
sociology," Note that kinship , or one ’s traceable ancestry , can be based on blood or marriage or adoption .","1"
sociology," Sixty percent of societies , mostly modernized nations , follow a bilateral descent pattern .","0"
sociology," 5754 . While sociologists use the family life cycle to study the dynamics of family over time , consumer and marketing researchers have used it to determine what goods and services families need as they progress through each stage ( Murphy and Staples 1979 ) .","0"
sociology," As early “ stage ” theories have been criticized for generalizing family life and not accounting for differences in gender , ethnicity , culture , and lifestyle , less rigid models of the family life cycle have been developed .","0"
sociology," One example is the family life course , which recognizes the events that occur in the lives of families but views them as parting terms of a fluid course rather than in consecutive stages ( Strong and DeVault 1992 ) .","1"
sociology," This type of model accounts for changes in family development , such as the fact that in today ’s society , childbearing does not always occur with marriage .","0"
sociology," 5766 . A denomination is a large , mainstream religious organization , but it does not claim to be official or state sponsored .","1"
sociology," It is one religion among many .","0"
sociology," 5784 . This story illustrates a growing concern referred to as grade inflation — a term used to describe the observation that the correspondence between letter grades and the achievements they reflect has been changing ( in a downward direction ) over time .","1"
sociology," Put simply , what used to be considered C - level , or average , now often earns a student a B , or even an A .","0"
sociology," 5333 . It includes everything produced by a society , including all of the social rules .","0"
sociology," Sociologists often study culture using the sociological imagination , which pioneer sociologist C. Wright Mills described as an awareness of the relationship between a person ’s behavior and experience and the wider culture that shaped the person ’s choices and perceptions .","1"
sociology," It ’s a way of seeing our own and other people ’s behavior in relationship to history and social structure ( 1959 ) .","0"
sociology," 5423 . While pastoral and horticultural societies used small , temporary tools such as digging sticks or hoes , agricultural societies relied on permanent tools for survival .","1"
sociology," Around 3000 B.C.E. , an explosion of new technology known as the Agricultural Revolution made farming possible — and profitable .","1"
sociology," 5447 . One person can be associated with a multitude of roles and statuses .","0"
sociology," Even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or array of roles , attached to it ( Merton 1957 ) .","0"
sociology," If too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role strain .","0"
sociology," 5453 . Half these people were children .","0"
sociology," A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , while asylum - seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated .","1"
sociology," An internally displaced person , on the other hand , is neither a refugee nor an asylum - seeker .","0"
sociology," 5462 . Functional perspectives on urbanization generally focus on the ecology of the city , while conflict perspective tends to focus on political economy .","0"
sociology," Human ecology is a functionalist field of study that looks at on the relationship between people and their built and natural physical environments ( Park 1915 ) .","1"
sociology," Generally speaking , urban land use and urban population distribution occur in a predictable pattern once we understand how people relate to their living environment .","0"
sociology," 5627 . A class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement .","1"
sociology," A class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth , income , education , and occupation .","1"
sociology," 5639 . In turn , those parents may have been raised in the lower class .","0"
sociology," Patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long - term societal changes . Similarly , intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person 's social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime .","1"
sociology," For example , the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings . Structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder .","1"
sociology," 5305 . Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .","1"
sociology," The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .","1"
sociology," A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .","1"
sociology," 5452 . Urbanization is the study of the social , political , and economic relationships in cities , and someone specializing in urban sociology studies those relationships .","1"
sociology," In some ways , cities can be microcosms of universal human behavior , while in others they provide a unique environment that yields its own brand of human behavior .","0"
sociology," 5476 . Thomas Malthus ( 1766 – 1834 ) was an English clergyman who made dire predictions about earth ’s ability to sustain its growing population .","0"
sociology," According to Malthusian theory , three factors would control human population that exceeded the earth ’s carrying capacity , or how many people can live in a given area considering the amount of available resources .","0"
sociology," Malthus identified these factors as war , famine , and disease ( Malthus 1798 ) .","0"
sociology," 5479 . Societies develop along a predictable continuum as they evolve from unindustrialized to postindustrial .","0"
sociology," Demographic transition theory ( Caldwell and Caldwell 2006 ) suggests that future population growth will develop along a predictable four - stage model .","1"
sociology," In Stage 1 , birth , death , and infant mortality rates are all high , while life expectancy is short .","0"
sociology," An example of this stage is the 1800s in the United States .","0"
sociology," 5503 . We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader .","0"
sociology," In contrast , expressive leaders are more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health , and ensuring that people feel supported .","1"
sociology," Social and religious leaders — rabbis , priests , imams , directors of youth homes and social service programs — are often perceived as expressive leaders .","0"
sociology," 5509 . A complaint of modern life is that society is dominated by large and impersonal secondary organizations .","0"
sociology," From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized .","0"
sociology," Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies .","0"
sociology," 5605 . Globalization refers to the process of integrating governments , cultures , and financial markets through international trade into a single world market .","1"
sociology," Often , the process begins with a single motive , such as market expansion ( on the part of a corporation ) or increased access to healthcare ( on the part of a nonprofit organization ) .","0"
sociology," 5629 . Though family and other societal models help guide a person toward a career , personal choice plays a role .","0"
sociology," In class systems , people have the option to form exogamous marriages , unions of spouses from different social categories .","1"
sociology," Marriage in these circumstances is based on values such as love and compatibility rather than on social standing or economics .","0"
sociology," 5716 . These differences are based on cultural attitudes toward aging .","0"
sociology," In China , several studies have noted the attitude of filial piety ( deference and respect to one ’s parents and ancestors in all things ) as defining all other virtues ( Hsu 1971 ; Hamilton 1990 ) .","0"
sociology," Cultural attitudes in Japan prior to approximately 1986 supported the idea that the elderly deserve assistance ( Ogawa and Retherford 1993 ) .","0"
sociology," 5728 . The earliest gerontological theory in the functionalist perspective is disengagement theory , which suggests that withdrawing from society and social relationships is a natural part of growing old .","1"
sociology," There are several main points to the theory .","0"
sociology," 5737 . Not even sociologists are able to agree on a single meaning .","0"
sociology," For our purposes , we ’ll define marriage as a legally recognized social contract between two people , traditionally based on a sexual relationship and implying a permanence of the union .","1"
sociology," In practicing cultural relativism , we should also consider variations , such as whether a legal union is required ( think of “ common law ” marriage and its equivalents ) , or whether more than two people can be involved ( consider polygamy ) .","0"
sociology," 5758 . Infants are also often victims of physical abuse , particularly in the form of violent shaking .","0"
sociology," This type of physical abuse is referred to as shaken - baby syndrome , which describes a group of medical symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal hemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or causing impact to an infant ’s head .","1"
sociology," A baby ’s cry is the number one trigger for shaking .","0"
government," 5814 . If private schools were the only educational institutions , most poor and working - class children and many middle - class children would be uneducated .","0"
government," Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good .","0"
government," Toll goods are available to many people , and many people can make use of them , but only if they can pay the price .","1"
government," 5817 . In the United States , for example , Congress passes laws regulating banking , and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories , the purity of food offered for sale , and the safety of toys and automobiles .","0"

government," 5886 . Following the Revolution , some of the northern states had either abolished slavery or instituted plans by which slaves would gradually be emancipated .","0"
government," Pennsylvania , for example , had passed the Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1780 .","0"

government," 5952 . Lastly , three civil rights amendments — the Fifteenth , Nineteenth , and Twenty - Sixth — prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens ’ right to vote based on race , sex , and age .","0"
government," This topic remains controversial because states have not always ensured equal protection .","0"
government," The supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution regulates relationships between the federal and state governments by declaring that the Constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land .","1"
government," This means that if a state law clashes with a federal law found to be within the national government ’s constitutional authority , the federal law prevails .","0"
government," 6003 . During the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon ( 1969–1974 ) and Ronald Reagan ( 1981–1989 ) , attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization — that is , to restore states ’ prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past .","0"
government," New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .","0"
government," 6021 . Finally , some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations , whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments .","1"

government," 6117 . During this period , the Supreme Court ’s decisions regarding the meaning of the Second Amendment were ambiguous at best .","0"
government," In United States v. Miller , the Supreme Court upheld the 1934 National Firearms Act ’s prohibition of sawed - off shotguns , largely on the basis that possession of such a gun was not related to the goal of promoting a “ well regulated militia .","1"
government," ”United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 ( 1939 ) .","1"
government," This finding was generally interpreted as meaning that the Second Amendment protected the right of the states to organize a militia , rather than an individual right , and thus lower courts generally found most firearm regulations — including some city and state laws that virtually outlawed the private ownership of firearms — to be constitutional .","0"
government," 6141 . The reexamination of past cases through DNA evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed .","0"

government," Perhaps as a result of this and other cases , seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007 .","0"
government," As of 2015 , nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases , and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death . See , for example , “ States With and Without the Death Penalty , ” Death Penalty Information Center , http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty ( March 4 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .","0"
government," 6159 . In the modern era , laws and actions that are challenged under strict scrutiny have rarely been upheld .","0"
government," Strict scrutiny , however , was the legal basis for the Supreme Court ’s 1944 upholding of the legality of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II , discussed later in this chapter . Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214 ( 1944 ) .","0"
government," Finally , affirmative action consists of government programs and policies designed to benefit members of groups historically subject to discrimination .","0"

government," To ensure their vote was largely meaningless , the white elites used their control of the Democratic Party to create the white primary : primary elections in which only whites were allowed to vote .","1"
government," The state party organizations argued that as private groups , rather than part of the state government , they had no obligation to follow the Fifteenth Amendment ’s requirement not to deny the right to vote on the basis of race .","0"
government," 6189 . In 1962 , Congress proposed what later became the Twenty - Fourth Amendment , which banned the poll tax in elections to federal ( but not state or local ) office ; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964 .","1"
government," Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when , in the case of Harper v.

government," 6471 . Then , legislative seats are doled out to the parties based on the proportion of support each party receives .","0"
government," While the Green Party in the United States might not win a single congressional seat in some years thanks to plurality voting , in a proportional system , it stands a chance to get a few seats in the legislature regardless .","0"
government," For example , assume the Green Party gets 7 percent of the vote .","0"
government," 6483 . By fostering a sense of loyalty , a party can insulate itself from changes in the system and improve its odds of winning elections .","0"
government," The party - in - the - electorate are those members of the voting public who consider themselves to be part of a political party and/or who consistently prefer the candidates of one party over the other .","1"
government," 6507 . However , in its one - person - one - vote decision in Reynolds v. Simms ( 1964 ) , the Supreme Court argued that everyone ’s vote should count roughly the same regardless of where they lived . Reynolds v. Simms , 379 U.S. 870 ( 1964 ) .","0"

government," Nownes and Newmark , “ Interest Groups in the States . ”","0"
government," Inside lobbying tactics include testifying in legislative hearings and helping to draft legislation .","0"
government," Numerous surveys of lobbyists have confirmed that the vast majority rely on these inside strategies .","0"
government," 6549 . AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .","0"
government," Group leaders may also offer solidary incentives , which provide the benefit of joining with others who have the same concerns or are similar in other ways .","1"

Her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors , although in the early 1960s , Jacqueline Kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the White House along historical lines , and Lady Bird Johnson in the mid- and late 1960s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the United States .","0"
government," She also established the foundations of what came to be known as the Office of the First Lady , complete with a news reporter , Liz Carpenter , as her press secretary .","0"
government," 6747 . Starting in New York in 1790 , the early Supreme Court focused on establishing its rules and procedures and perhaps trying to carve its place as the new government ’s third branch .","1"
government," However , given the difficulty of getting all the justices even to show up , and with no permanent home or building of its own for decades , finding its footing in the early days proved to be a monumental task .","0"
government," 6759 . People who opposed the law and understood that a congressional repeal would not happen any time soon looked to the courts for help .","0"

government," The executive performs functions similar to those of the state governor .","0"
government," 6942 . A number of laws passed in the decades between the end of the Second World War and the late 1970s have created a framework through which citizens can exercise their own bureaucratic oversight .","0"

government," Like many of the modern bureaucratic reforms in the United States , both emerged during a period of heightened skepticism about government activities .","0"
government," 6951 . They turn instead to the vast government bureaucracy to provide policy guidance .","0"
government," For example , when Congress passed the Clean Water Act ( 1972 ) , it dictated that steps should be taken to improve water quality throughout the country .","1"
government," But it ultimately left it to the bureaucracy to figure out exactly how ‘ clean ’ water needed to be .","0"
government," 6954 . For example , your home or apartment is a private good reserved for your own use because you pay rent or make mortgage payments for the privilege of living there .","0"
government," Further , private goods are finite and can run out if overused , even if only in the short term .","0"
government," The fact that private goods are excludable and finite makes them tradable .","0"
government," 6969 . In societies operating in survival mode , in contrast , people tend to focus more on short - term problem - solving than on long - term planning .","0"
government," Second , social welfare policy creates an automatic stimulus for a society by building a safety net that can catch members of society who are suffering economic hardship through no fault of their own .","0"
government," For an individual family , this safety net makes the difference between eating and starving ; for an entire economy , it could prevent an economic recession from sliding into a broader and more damaging depression .","0"
government," 6999 . What is foreign policy ?","0"

government," Both levels have three basic tiers consisting of trial courts , appellate courts , and finally courts of last resort , typically called supreme courts , at the top ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," 6779 . Decisions of the higher courts are binding on the lower courts .","0"
government," The precedent set by each ruling , particularly by the Supreme Court ’s decisions , both builds on principles and guidelines set by earlier cases and frames the ongoing operation of the courts , steering the direction of the entire system .","0"
government," Reliance on precedent has enabled the federal courts to operate with logic and consistency that has helped validate their role as the key interpreters of the Constitution and the law — a legitimacy particularly vital in the United States where citizens do not elect federal judges and justices but are still subject to their rulings .","0"

government," 5815 . Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods : goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply , such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water .","1"
government," Because everyone can use these goods , they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing .","0"

government," Some states introduced a loophole , known as the grandfather clause , to allow less literate whites to vote .","0"
government," The grandfather clause exempted those who had been allowed to vote in that state prior to the Civil War and their descendants from literacy and understanding tests . Keyssar , 112 .","1"
government," Because blacks were not allowed to vote prior to the Civil War , but most white men had been voting at a time when there were no literacy tests , this loophole allowed most illiterate whites to vote ( [ link ] ) while leaving obstacles in place for blacks who wanted to vote as well .","0"

government," 6262 . A magazine might run a story on climate change by interviewing representatives of only one side of the policy debate and downplaying the opposing view , all without acknowledging the one - sided nature of its coverage .","0"
government," In contrast , when the writer or publication makes clear to the reader or viewer that the information offers only one side of the political debate , the political message is overt content .","0"
government," Political commentators like Rush Limbaugh and publications like Mother Jones openly state their ideological viewpoints .","0"

government," This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .","0"
government," Finally , Article VI declared that the U.S. Constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level . This clause , better known as the supremacy clause , makes clear that any conflict in law between the central ( or federal ) government and the regional ( or state ) governments is typically resolved in favor of the central government .","1"
