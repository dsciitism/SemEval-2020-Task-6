biology," 335 . Once a ligand binds to a receptor , the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm .","1"
biology," Continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction .","0"
biology," Signal transduction only occurs with cell - surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis .","0"
biology," 338 . After the ligand binds to the cell - surface receptor , the activation of the receptor ’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade .","0"
biology," In a signaling pathway , second messengers , enzymes , and activated proteins interact with specific proteins , which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell ’s environment ( [ link ] ) .","1"

biology," Somatic cells are sometimes referred to as “ body ” cells .","0"
biology," 401 . Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis , the same stage names are assigned .","0"
biology," However , because there are two rounds of division , the major process and the stages are designated with a “ I ” or a “ II . ”","0"
biology," Thus , meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I , prometaphase I , and so on .","1"
biology," Meiosis II , in which the second round of meiotic division takes place , includes prophase II , prometaphase II , and so on .","1"
biology," 404 . In mitosis , homologous chromosomes line up end - to - end so that when they divide , each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair .","0"
biology," The synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .","1"
biology," The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .","1"
biology," 407 . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .","0"
biology," These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .","1"
biology," 410 . In some species , cells enter a brief interphase , or interkinesis , before entering meiosis II .","0"
biology," Interkinesis lacks an S phase , so chromosomes are not duplicated .","0"
biology," 413 . Fertilization , the joining of two haploid gametes , restores the diploid condition .","1"
biology," There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms : diploid - dominant , in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with most animals including humans ; haploid - dominant , in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with all fungi and some algae ; and alternation of generations , in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group , as with plants and some algae .","1"
biology," 416 . Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote .","1"

biology," Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores .","0"
biology," 419 . Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents ’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .","0"
biology," The blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring , but we now know that this is not the case .","1"
biology," Mendel was the first researcher to see it .","0"
biology," 422 . Plants used in first - generation crosses were called P0 , or parental generation one , plants ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .","0"
biology," 425 . In his 1865 publication , Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics , each with two contrasting traits .","0"
biology," A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic .","1"
biology," The characteristics included plant height , seed texture , seed color , flower color , pea pod size , pea pod color , and flower position .","0"
biology," 428 . Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization .","1"
biology," Recessive traits become latent , or disappear , in the offspring of a hybridization .","1"
biology," The recessive trait does , however , reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring .","0"
biology," 431 . For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic , a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic .","0"
biology," Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles .","1"
biology," Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms , but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population .","0"
biology," 434 . The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying .","0"
biology," Diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene , or locus , have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes .","0"
biology," Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .","0"
biology," 437 . The dominant seed color is yellow ; therefore , the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds , respectively .","0"
biology," A Punnett square , devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett , can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies .","1"
biology," To prepare a Punnett square , all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top ( for one parent ) and side ( for the other parent ) of a grid , representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes .","0"
biology," 440 . ( Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness . )","0"
biology," This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance , denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype .","1"
biology," The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers .","0"
biology," 443 . Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .","0"
biology," All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .","1"
biology," The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild - type allele .","0"
biology," 446 . Because of the location of the eye - color gene , reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios .","0"
biology," Males are said to be hemizygous , because they have only one allele for any X - linked characteristic .","1"
biology," Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males .","0"
biology," 449 . Mendel ’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote , one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic .","1"
biology," Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype , the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively .","0"
biology," 452 . Mendel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .","1"
biology," The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .","1"
biology," Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants , one that has green , wrinkled seeds ( yyrr ) and another that has yellow , round seeds ( YYRR ) .","0"
biology," 455 . That same year , Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Together , these observations led to the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance , which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance .","1"
biology," 458 . Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .","0"
biology," Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .","1"
biology," Morgan and his colleagues , however , found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent ( AaBb × aabb ) , both parental and nonparental cases occurred .","0"
biology," 461 . The isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans .","0"
biology," A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .","1"
biology," To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 464 . For instance , Jacobsen Syndrome — which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects — is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11 .","1"
biology," Finally , the karyotype can pinpoint translocations , which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome .","1"
biology," Translocations are implicated in certain cancers , including chronic myelogenous leukemia .","0"
biology," 467 . An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .","1"
biology," An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .","1"
biology," Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes .","0"
biology," 470 . A chromosome inversion is the detachment , 180 ° rotation , and reinsertion of part of a chromosome .","1"
biology," Inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear , or from the action of transposable elements ( special DNA sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences ) .","1"
biology," 473 . A half century later , British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “ horizontally , ” rather than by descent .","0"
biology," In 1928 , he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation , a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell , thereby changing morphology and physiology .","1"
biology," He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterium that causes pneumonia .","1"
biology," 476 . ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .","0"
biology," As the DNA opens up , Y - shaped structures called replication forks are formed .","0"
biology," Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds .","0"
biology," 479 . Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .","1"
biology," Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .","0"
biology," DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer , adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 482 . Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .","0"
biology," The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand .","1"
biology," 485 . The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I , and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides .","0"
biology," The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA ( that replaced the RNA primer ) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5 ' phosphate end of the other fragment .","1"

biology," 491 . Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .","1"
biology," Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .","1"
biology," 494 . These can be of two types , either transitions or transversions .","0"
biology," Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .","1"
biology," Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .","1"
biology," 497 . The discovery of the enzyme telomerase ( [ link ] ) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained .","0"
biology," The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built - in RNA template .","1"
biology," It attaches to the end of the chromosome , and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3 ' end of the DNA strand .","0"
biology," 500 . In contrast , there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets ( 43 ) , which is far more than the number of amino acids .","0"
biology," Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate .","0"
biology," In other words , a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet .","0"
biology," 503 . In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain , three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery .","1"

biology," For example , the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box ( GGCCAATCT ) at approximately -80 .","0"
biology," This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .","0"
biology," 521 . For polynucleotide synthesis to occur , the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome .","0"
biology," This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT , which stands for “ facilitates chromatin transcription . ” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it .","1"

biology," 596 . Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes ( similar to a detailed road map ) .","0"
biology," A physical map is a representation of the physical distance , in nucleotides , between genes or genetic markers .","1"
biology," Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome .","0"
biology," 599 . Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLP ) , variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTRs ) , microsatellite polymorphisms , and the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .","0"
biology," RFLPs ( sometimes pronounced “ rif - lips ” ) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments , which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis .","1"
biology," 602 . This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency .","0"
biology," Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs .","1"
biology," The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping .","1"
biology," 605 . Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years , doctors are still confounded by some diseases , and they are using whole - genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem .","0"
biology," Whole - genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome .","1"
biology," Whole - genome sequencing is a brute - force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease .","0"
biology," 608 . In shotgun sequencing method , several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces ( somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun ) .","1"
biology," All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain - sequencing method .","0"
biology," 614 . DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences .","1"
biology," Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays , whereas whole - genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome .","0"
biology," 617 . Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics .","0"
biology," Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .","1"
biology," The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .","1"
biology," 620 . Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer ; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process .","1"
biology," An individual protein is called a biomarker , whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature .","0"
biology," For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer , it must be secreted in body fluids , such as sweat , blood , or urine , such that large - scale screenings can be performed in a non - invasive fashion .","0"
biology," 626 . Darwin called this mechanism natural selection .","0"
biology," Natural selection , also known as “ survival of the fittest , ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits ; this leads to evolutionary change .","1"
biology," 629 . Sometimes , evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other .","0"
biology," When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point , it is called divergent evolution .","1"
biology," Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies ; however , they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor .","0"
biology," 632 . Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all , and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor .","1"
biology," These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures .","0"
biology," Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds , leaves on some cacti , and hind leg bones in whales .","0"
biology," 638 . For example , even though bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) and African fish eagles ( Haliaeetus vocifer ) are both birds and eagles , each belongs to a separate species group ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch , that offspring , called a hybrid ( a cross between two species ) , would probably be infertile — unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity .","1"
biology," Different species may have different genes that are active in development ; therefore , it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions .","0"
biology," 641 . Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution .","1"
biology," Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location .","1"
biology," 644 . Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed .","1"
biology," In some cases , a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The prefix “ auto- ” means “ self , ” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one ’s own species .","1"
biology," 647 . Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg : the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually .","1"
biology," Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .","1"
biology," A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .","0"
biology," 650 . In some cases , populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species .","1"
biology," This situation is called habitat isolation .","0"
biology," Reproduction with the parent species ceases , and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent .","0"
biology," 653 . Hybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages .","1"
biology," This is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable .","0"
biology," In another postzygotic situation , reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own ; this is called hybrid sterility .","1"
biology," 662 . Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences , or genetic variance , among individuals in a population .","1"
biology," The greater the hereditability of a population ’s phenotypic variation , the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation .","0"
biology," 665 . While it is likely to happen at some point , it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population , and as a result , the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool .","0"
biology," However , if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other , this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring , a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression .","1"
biology," 668 . Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events , such as a natural disaster that kills — at random — a large portion of the population .","0"
biology," Known as the bottleneck effect , it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," In one fell swoop , the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population , which may be very different from the pre - disaster population .","0"
biology," 671 . Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection .","0"
biology," One common form of mate choice , called assortative mating , is an individual ’s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves .","1"
biology," 674 . Natural selection only acts on the population ’s heritable traits : selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population , while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency — a process known as adaptive evolution .","1"
biology," Natural selection does not act on individual alleles , however , but on entire organisms .","0"
biology," 677 . If natural selection favors an average phenotype , selecting against extreme variation , the population will undergo stabilizing selection ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," In a population of mice that live in the woods , for example , natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators .","0"
biology," 680 . Another type of selection , called frequency - dependent selection , favors phenotypes that are either common ( positive frequency - dependent selection ) or rare ( negative frequency - dependent selection ) .","1"
biology," An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest .","0"
biology," 683 . The good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease .","1"
biology," Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority , which they will then pass on to their offspring .","0"
biology," 686 . Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms .","0"
biology," A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms .","1"
biology," Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships .","0"
biology," 689 . The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .","1"
biology," A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .","1"
biology," When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .","1"
biology," 692 . Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time ; these disciplines together contribute to building , updating , and maintaining the “ tree of life . ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics .","0"
biology," Data may be collected from fossils , from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism , and by DNA analysis .","0"
biology," 695 . Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .","1"
biology," After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 698 . This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions .","0"
biology," When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship , it is called an analogy or homoplasy .","1"
biology," For example , insects use wings to fly like bats and birds , but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different .","0"
biology," 704 . To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately , scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony , which means that events occurred in the simplest , most obvious way .","1"
biology," For example , if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking , based on the principle of maximum parsimony , one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones .","0"
biology," 710 . The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link ] b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .","1"
biology," Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link ] c ) .","1"
biology," All of these hypotheses are testable .","0"
biology," 713 . Virions , single virus particles , are very small , about 20–250 nanometers in diameter .","0"
biology," These individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell .","1"
biology," 716 . Viruses come in many shapes and sizes , but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family .","0"
biology," All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins , called a capsid .","1"
biology," The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres .","0"
biology," 719 . Glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells .","1"
biology," Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions .","1"
biology," Chicken pox , influenza , and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes .","0"
biology," 722 . Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .","0"
biology," Group II viruses have single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as their genome .","1"
biology," They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .","0"
biology," 725 . Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .","1"
biology," Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .","1"
biology," Intermediates of dsRNA , called replicative intermediates , are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA .","1"
biology," 728 . Additionally , full - length positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative - stranded genome .","0"
biology," Group VI viruses have diploid ( two copies ) ssRNA genomes that must be converted , using the enzyme reverse transcriptase , to dsDNA ; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .","1"
biology," 731 . The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell , which may cause cell damage .","1"
biology," These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .","0"
biology," Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .","1"
biology," 737 . When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .","1"
biology," If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4 , which infects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract .","0"
biology," 740 . An example is the animal herpesviruses , including herpes simplex viruses , the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans .","0"
biology," In a process called latency , these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions , only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates .","1"
biology," Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency , the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages .","0"
biology," 743 . Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .","0"
biology," Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .","0"
biology," Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .","1"
biology," 746 . Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors , through contact with an infected plant ’s sap , by living organisms such as insects and nematodes , and through pollen .","1"
biology," When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission .","1"
biology," Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .","1"
biology," 752 . The danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .","0"
biology," Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .","1"
biology," Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus , allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host .","0"
biology," 755 . The use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them .","0"
biology," Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic - resistant bacteria , its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries .","0"
biology," However , the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria .","0"
biology," As more and more antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria evolve , the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem , and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide .","0"
biology," 758 . It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle .","0"
biology," PrP exists in two forms , PrPc , the normal form of the protein , and PrPsc , the infectious form .","0"
biology," Once introduced into the body , the PrPsc contained within the prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc .","0"
biology," 761 . Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth ; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago .","0"
biology," A microbial mat is a multi - layered sheet of prokaryotes ( [ link ] ) that includes mostly bacteria , but also archaea .","1"
biology," Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick , and they typically grow where different types of materials interface , mostly on moist surfaces .","0"
biology," 767 . Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .","1"
biology," Then , cyanobacteria , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later .","0"
biology," Cyanobacteria ( [ link ] ) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere .","1"
biology," 770 . In other cases , culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions , even though the same organism could be cultured previously .","0"
biology," Those organisms that can not be cultured but are not dead are in a viable - but - non - culturable ( VBNC ) state .","1"
biology," The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival .","0"
biology," 773 . The cell wall functions as a protective layer , and it is responsible for the organism ’s shape .","1"
biology," Some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall .","0"
biology," Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species , but not in others ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 776 . There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan .","0"
biology," S - layer ( surface layer ) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria .","1"
biology," 779 . There are four different types of Archaean cell walls .","0"
biology," One type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan , which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain .","1"
biology," The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides , glycoproteins , or pure protein .","0"
biology," 788 . Gaseous nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation .","1"
biology," Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms .","0"
biology," Another source of ammonia is ammonification , the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen - containing organic compounds .","1"
biology," Ammonia released to the atmosphere , however , represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released ; the rest is as N2 and N2O .","0"
biology," 791 . Epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population .","1"
biology," An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .","1"
biology," A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .","1"
biology," 794 . One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death ( 1346 to 1361 ) that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis .","0"
biology," It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread along the Silk Road , a network of land and sea trade routes , to the Mediterranean region and Europe , carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships .","0"
biology," 797 . The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning “ against ” and bios meaning “ life . ”","0"
biology," An antibiotic is a chemical , produced either by microbes or synthetically , that is hostile to the growth of other organisms .","1"
biology," Today ’s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis .","0"
biology," 800 . Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common .","0"
biology," A foodborne disease ( colloquially called “ food poisoning ” ) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria , viruses , or other parasites that contaminate food .","1"
biology," Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness . ”","0"
biology," The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .","0"

biology," Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals ( pesticides , fertilizers ) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface .","0"
biology," 809 . Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic .","0"
biology," Their cells contain , in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles , another kind of organelle called a plastid .","0"
biology," When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis , their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments , called accessory pigments , which are involved in harvesting energy from light .","1"
biology," 812 . Subtypes of heterotrophs , called saprobes , absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes .","1"
biology," Some protists can function as mixotrophs , obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes , depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available .","1"
biology," 815 . The human parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa , the kinetoplastids .","0"
biology," The kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast , a DNA mass carried within the single , oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells .","1"
biology," This subgroup includes several parasites , collectively called trypanosomes , which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle .","1"
biology," 818 . Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane , called the anal pore .","1"
biology," In addition to a vacuole - based digestive system , Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles , which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell .","1"
biology," 821 . The protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod , thereby moving the entire cell .","0"
biology," This type of motion , called cytoplasmic streaming , is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen .","1"
biology," 824 . For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi .","0"
biology," The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae .","1"
biology," Through mycorrhizae , the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water , greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively , lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner ( usually an alga ) .","1"
biology," 827 . Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions .","1"
biology," Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts .","1"
biology," Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) and Candida species ( the agents of thrush , a common fungal infection ) are examples of unicellular fungi ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 830 . Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa ( singular , septum ) ( [ link ] a , c ) .","1"
biology," In most phyla of fungi , tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha .","0"
biology," 833 . Most fungi are obligate aerobes , requiring oxygen to survive .","1"
biology," Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .","1"
biology," Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .","0"
biology," 836 . The rings swell when they touch the nematode , gripping it in a tight hold .","0"
biology," The fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria .","0"
biology," Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria , as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host , release digestive enzymes within the host 's body , and absorb the digested nutrients .","1"
biology," 839 . When both mating types are present in the same mycelium , it is called homothallic , or self - fertile .","1"

biology," The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota , or true fungi .","1"
biology," 845 . The majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum Ascomycota , which is characterized by the formation of an ascus ( plural , asci ) , a sac - like structure that contains haploid ascospores .","1"
biology," Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance .","0"
biology," 848 . This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage .","0"
biology," Eventually , the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp , which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground — this is what we think of as a mushroom .","1"

biology," Mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms .","1"
biology," In addition , individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions .","0"
biology," 860 . The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota , Basidiomycota or Zygomycota .","0"
biology," In a second type , the Glomeromycete fungi form vesicular – arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza ( sometimes called endomycorrhizae ) .","0"
biology," In these mycorrhiza , the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 863 . Most biologists also consider green algae to be plants , although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom .","0"
biology," The reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae , the Charophytes , share common characteristics with land plants ( such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants ) .","0"
biology," These characteristics are absent in other types of algae .","0"
biology," 866 . Two different types of spores are produced in land plants , resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle .","0"
biology," Seedless non - vascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous .","1"
biology," The gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants .","0"
biology," 869 . The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .","1"
biology," Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants .","0"

biology," 875 . In a further division , land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue , as detailed in [ link ] .","0"
biology," Plants that lack vascular tissue , which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients , are referred to as non - vascular plants .","1"
biology," Liverworts , mosses , and hornworts are seedless , non - vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution .","0"
biology," 878 . Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually , by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae .","0"
biology," In this latter type of reproduction , the gemmae — small , intact , complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus ( shown in [ link ] ) — are splashed out of the cup by raindrops .","0"
biology," The gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes .","0"
biology," 881 . For example , stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte , and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophyte ’s stalk .","0"
biology," Additionally , mosses are anchored to the substrate — whether it is soil , rock , or roof tiles — by multicellular rhizoids .","0"
biology," These structures are precursors of roots .","0"
biology," 884 . A structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal .","1"
biology," The concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular , close - fitting units , a little like “ teeth ” ; these open and close depending on moisture levels , and periodically release spores .","0"
biology," 887 . The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma .","1"
biology," Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls , and are thus described as lignified .","1"
biology," Lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue .","1"

biology," While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots , the whisk ferns , Class Psilotopsida , lack both roots and leaves , probably lost by reduction .","0"
biology," Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems , and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia .","0"
biology," 902 . Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation .","0"
biology," The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium , and later , the embryo , is called the integument .","1"
biology," 905 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale .","0"
biology," One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule .","0"
biology," 908 . Cycads thrive in mild climates , and are often mistaken for palms because of the shape of their large , compound leaves .","0"
biology," Cycads bear large cones ( [ link ] ) , and may be pollinated by beetles rather than wind : unusual for a gymnosperm .","0"
biology," 911 . The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant .","1"
biology," A whorl of sepals ( collectively called the calyx ) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud .","1"
biology," Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs , although there are some exceptions .","0"
biology," 917 . The ovary houses one or more ovules , each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .","1"
biology," Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .","1"
biology," 920 . The other sperm fuses with the 2n polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm , which is tissue that serves as a food reserve .","1"
biology," The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle , or small root , and one ( monocot ) or two ( dicot ) leaf - like organs called cotyledons .","1"
biology," This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms : the monocots and the eudicots .","0"
biology," 923 . Monocots include grasses and lilies , and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group .","0"
biology," Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups .","1"
biology," They are categorized separately in many classification schemes .","0"
biology," 926 . Explore this website for additional information on pollinators . More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination : the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma .","1"
biology," Consequently , plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators .","0"
biology," 929 . Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action , from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species .","0"
biology," Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .","1"
biology," Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .","1"
biology," 932 . The first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period , about 319 million years ago ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms , the first naked seed plants , which arose about 380 million years ago .","1"
biology," Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers ( cone bearers ) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues ; however , they still reproduced like ferns , releasing spores into the environment .","1"
biology," 935 . Seed ferns ( [ link ] ) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures .","1"
biology," What makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule — the female gametophyte and associated tissues — which develops into a seed upon fertilization .","1"
biology," Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous period .","0"
biology," 941 . Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .","0"
biology," After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells , a 6–32-celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed .","1"
biology," Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .","1"
biology," 944 . Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .","1"
biology," These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types , organs , and organ systems during a process called organogenesis .","1"
biology," 950 . Further subdivision of animals with three germ layers ( triploblasts ) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm , called a coelom , and those that do not .","1"
biology," This epithelial cell - lined coelomic cavity represents a space , usually filled with fluid , which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall .","0"
biology," 953 . A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm , which is found between the two layers .","1"
biology," Although still functional , these are considered false coeloms , and those animals are called pseudocoelomates .","0"

biology," 959 . The earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote .","0"
biology," Protostomes undergo spiral cleavage , meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated , and thus misaligned , with respect to the cells of the opposite pole .","1"
biology," This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .","0"
biology," 962 . A cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type .","0"
biology," In contrast , deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage , in which cells are not yet pre - determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types .","1"
biology," These cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells .","0"
biology," 965 . Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .","1"

biology," 974 . While sponges ( excluding the hexactinellids ) do not exhibit tissue - layer organization , they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions .","0"
biology," Pinacocytes , which are epithelial - like cells , form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly - like substance called mesohyl .","1"
biology," Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen - like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions .","1"
biology," 977 . In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .","1"
biology," In other sponges , ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge . Choanocytes ( “ collar cells ” ) are present at various locations , depending on the type of sponge , but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows ( the spongocoel in simple sponges , canals within the body wall in more complex sponges , and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges ) .","1"
biology," Whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge , choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl .","1"
biology," 980 . An atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules .","0"
biology," Gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted .","1"
biology," In gemmules , an inner layer of amoebocytes is surrounded by a layer of collagen ( spongin ) that may be reinforced by spicules .","0"

biology," An example of the polyp form is Hydra spp .","0"
biology," 986 . The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .","1"
biology," The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .","0"
biology," 989 . These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form .","0"
biology," The life cycle ( [ link ] ) of these animals can be described as polymorphic , because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle .","0"
biology," 992 . Rotifers obtain food that is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the corona .","0"
biology," The food particles enter the mouth and travel to the mastax ( pharynx with jaw - like structures ) .","1"
biology," Food then passes by digestive and salivary glands , and into the stomach , then onto the intestines .","0"
biology," 995 . Eggs and sperm are released into the water , and fertilization occurs externally .","0"

biology," In some species , like sea spiders , an additional pair of appendages , called ovigers , is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps .","0"
biology," 1022 . These buds , known as coelomic pouches , fuse to form the coelomic cavity , as they eventually separate from the endodermal layer .","0"
biology," The resultant coelom is termed an enterocoelom .","0"

biology," 1337 . Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber .","0"
biology," Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen .","1"

biology," 2096 . Traditionally , ecologists have measured biodiversity , a general term for the variety present in the biosphere , by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness .","1"
biology," Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things .","0"
biology," 2099 . Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts .","0"
biology," Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species .","1"
biology," 2102 . All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria ; therefore , the 500 species of cichlids were endemic .","0"
biology," Endemic species are found in only one location .","1"
biology," Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction .","0"
biology," 2105 . The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions , and a recent one .","0"
biology," It is well known that the North American , and to some degree Eurasian , megafauna , or large animals , disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period .","0"
biology," The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000 – 12,000 years ago .","0"
biology," 2108 . Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area .","0"
biology," Most plants produce secondary plant compounds , which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them , but some of which also work as medication .","1"
biology," For centuries in Europe , older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals — books that identified plants and their uses .","0"
biology," 2111 . Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve .","1"
biology," Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena .","0"
biology," 2114 . The technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planet ’s species in an accessible way is close to feasible .","0"
biology," DNA barcoding is one molecular genetic method , which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene present in eukaryotes , excepting the plants , to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene .","1"
biology," Plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes .","0"
biology," 1 . What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines ?","0"
biology," Science ( from the Latin scientia , meaning “ knowledge ” ) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws , especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method .","1"
biology," It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science .","0"
biology," 4 . A hypothesis may become a verified theory .","0"
biology," A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena .","1"
biology," Science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe .","1"
biology," 10 . A valid hypothesis must be testable .","0"
biology," It should also be falsifiable , meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results .","0"
biology," Importantly , science does not claim to “ prove ” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information .","0"
biology," 13 . Basic science or “ pure ” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short - term application of that knowledge .","0"
biology," It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value .","0"
biology," 16 . Instead , most scientists present their results in peer - reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals .","0"
biology," Peer - reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist ’s colleagues , or peers .","1"
biology," These colleagues are qualified individuals , often experts in the same research area , who judge whether or not the scientist ’s work is suitable for publication .","0"
biology," 19 . The introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal .","0"
biology," Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism .","1"
biology," 22 . The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .","0"
biology," In the discussion section , the researcher will interpret the results , describe how variables may be related , and attempt to explain the observations .","0"
biology," It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research .","0"
biology," 25 . These conditions may , however , change from one moment to the next .","0"
biology," Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly , despite environmental changes , through homeostasis ( literally , “ steady state ” ) — the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions .","1"
biology," For example , an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation .","0"
biology," 28 . A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .","1"
biology," Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .","1"
biology," An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( [ link ] ) , which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms .","1"
biology," 31 . Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic .","0"
biology," Prokaryotes are single - celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane - bound nuclei ; in contrast , the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane - bound organelles and a membrane - bound nucleus .","1"
biology," 34 . Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .","0"
biology," An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs .","1"
biology," Mammals have many organ systems .","0"
biology," 37 . For example , the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations .","0"
biology," A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area .","0"
biology," For instance , all of the trees , flowers , insects , and other populations in a forest form the forest ’s community .","0"
biology," 40 . The fact that biology , as a science , has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth .","0"
biology," The source of this diversity is evolution , the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species .","0"
biology," Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems .","0"
biology," 43 . For instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .","0"
biology," Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .","0"
biology," It is quite a broad branch itself , and depending on the subject of study , there are also microbial physiologists , ecologists , and geneticists , among others .","0"
biology," 46 . Paleontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .","0"
biology," Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists , ecologists , or physiologists , to name just a few areas .","0"
biology," 49 . To understand how elements come together , we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element , the atom .","0"
biology," An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element .","0"
biology," For example , one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature .","0"
biology," 52 . Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .","0"
biology," Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , weighing only 9.11 × 10 - 28 grams , or about 1 / 1800 of an atomic mass unit .","0"
biology," Hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’s overall atomic mass .","0"
biology," 55 . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number .","0"
biology," Since an element ’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes .","0"
biology," Often , the resulting number contains a fraction .","0"
biology," 58 . The different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table .","0"
biology," Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev ( 1834 – 1907 ) in 1869 , the table groups elements that , although unique , share certain chemical properties with other elements .","0"
biology," 61 . An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr ( 1885 – 1962 ) .","0"
biology," The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons , with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] .","0"
biology," These orbits form electron shells or energy levels , which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells .","0"
biology," 64 . Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration , while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable .","0"
biology," As a result of losing a negatively charged electron , they become positively charged ions .","0"
biology," Group 17 elements , including fluorine and chlorine , have seven electrons in their outmost shells , so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them negatively charged ions .","0"
biology," 67 . This is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable .","0"
biology," However , since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration .","0"
biology," When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other , the resultant chemical structure is a molecule .","0"
biology," 70 . In the equation below , the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules .","0"
biology," This is an example of a balanced chemical equation , wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation .","1"
biology," According to the law of conservation of matter , the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal , such that no atoms are , under normal circumstances , created or destroyed .","1"
biology," 73 . The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .","0"
biology," Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .","0"
biology," In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .","0"
biology," 76 . Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons , each ion has a net charge .","0"
biology," Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons .","1"
biology," Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions .","1"
biology," 79 . Ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges .","1"
biology," For instance , positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride , or table salt , creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge .","0"
biology," 82 . There are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar .","0"
biology," In a polar covalent bond , shown in [ link ] , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other .","1"
biology," Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ+ ) or slightly negative ( δ – ) charge develops .","0"
biology," 85 . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ – charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule .","1"
biology," This interaction is called a hydrogen bond .","0"
biology," This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules .","0"
biology," 88 . In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .","1"
biology," These nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -phobic = “ fearing ” ) .","0"
biology," 91 . Water also has a high heat of vaporization , the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas .","1"
biology," A considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 cal ) is required to accomplish this change in water .","0"
biology," 94 . The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .","1"
biology," This is referred to as a sphere of hydration , or a hydration shell , as illustrated in [ link ] and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water .","0"
biology," When ionic compounds are added to water , the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation .","0"
biology," Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions .","1"
biology," 97 . These cohesive forces are related to water ’s property of adhesion , or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules .","1"
biology," This attraction is sometimes stronger than water ’s cohesive forces , especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes .","0"
biology," 100 . Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers , high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH .","0"
biology," An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate .","1"
biology," A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH – ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH .","1"
biology," 103 . Buffers are the key .","0"
biology," Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH – , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival .","1"
biology," Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’s well - being .","0"
biology," 106 . So far , the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons , which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms .","1"
biology," Another type of hydrocarbon , aromatic hydrocarbons , consists of closed rings of carbon atoms .","1"
biology," 109 . Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .","1"
biology," Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .","1"
biology," For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans .","0"
biology," Geometric isomers , on the other hand , have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds .","1"
biology," 112 . Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules .","1"
biology," They are found along the “ carbon backbone ” of macromolecules .","0"
biology," 115 . Most macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called monomers .","1"
biology," The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers .","1"
biology," 118 . Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed , or “ sped up , ” by specific enzymes ; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds , requiring energy , while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy .","1"
biology," These reactions are similar for most macromolecules , but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class .","0"
biology," 121 . Monosaccharides ( mono- = “ one ” ; sacchar- = “ sweet ” ) are simple sugars , the most common of which is glucose .","1"
biology," In monosaccharides , the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven .","0"
biology," 124 . PolysaccharidesA long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide ( poly- = “ many ” ) .","1"
biology," The chain may be branched or unbranched , and it may contain different types of monosaccharides .","0"
biology," 127 . Arthropods ( insects , crustaceans , and others ) have an outer skeleton , called the exoskeleton , which protects their internal body parts ( as seen in the bee in [ link ] ) . This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin , which is a polysaccharide - containing nitrogen .","1"
biology," It is made of repeating units of N - acetyl - β - d - glucosamine , a modified sugar .","0"
biology," 130 . Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .","0"
biology," For example , palmitic acid , a saturated fatty acid , is derived from the palm tree .","1"
biology," Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea , the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts .","1"
biology," 133 . Consequently , they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet .","0"
biology," Omega-3 fatty acids ( like that shown in [ link ] ) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans ( the other being omega-6 fatty acid ) .","0"
biology," These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond .","0"
biology," 136 . Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier , steroids have a fused ring structure .","0"
biology," Although they do not resemble the other lipids , they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water .","0"
biology," 139 . Hormones are chemical - signaling molecules , usually small proteins or steroids , secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes , including growth , development , metabolism , and reproduction .","1"
biology," For example , insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level .","0"
biology," 142 . The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein 's shape , size , and function .","0"
biology," Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond , known as a peptide bond , which is formed by a dehydration reaction .","1"
biology," The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine , releasing a molecule of water .","0"
biology," 145 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .","0"
biology," The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Both structures are the α - helix structure — the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds .","1"
biology," 148 . It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process .","0"
biology," Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones ( or chaperonins ) that associate with the target protein during the folding process .","1"
biology," They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure , and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded .","0"
biology," 151 . The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell .","1"
biology," This intermediary is the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .","0"
biology," Other types of RNA — like rRNA , tRNA , and microRNA — are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation .","0"
biology," 154 . Adenine and guanine are classified as purines .","0"
biology," The primary structure of a purine is two carbon - nitrogen rings .","0"
biology," 157 . In this way , the mRNA is read and the protein product is made .","0"
biology," Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds .","1"
biology," The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes ; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity ( peptidyl transferase ) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids .","0"
biology," 160 . With few exceptions , individual cells can not be seen with the naked eye , so scientists use microscopes ( micro- = “ small ” ; -scope = “ to look at ” ) to study them .","0"
biology," A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object .","1"
biology," Most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope , and these images can also be called micrographs . The optics of a microscope ’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees .","1"
biology," 163 . By the late 1830s , botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory , which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells , the cell is the basic unit of life , and new cells arise from existing cells .","1"
biology," Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory .","0"
biology," 166 . Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function , especially in cell biology , and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Unlike prokaryotic cells , eukaryotic cells have : 1 ) a membrane - bound nucleus ; 2 ) numerous membrane - bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , chloroplasts , mitochondria , and others ; and 3 ) several , rod - shaped chromosomes .","1"
biology," Because a eukaryotic cell ’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane , it is often said to have a “ true nucleus . ” The word “ organelle ” means “ little organ , ” and , as already mentioned , organelles have specialized cellular functions , just as the organs of your body have specialized functions .","1"
biology," At this point , it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells .","0"
biology," 169 . The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .","1"
biology," It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water , it has a semi - solid consistency , which comes from the proteins within it .","0"
biology," 172 . The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions , molecules , and RNA between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm .","1"
biology," The nucleoplasm is the semi - solid fluid inside the nucleus , where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus .","1"
biology," 175 . Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA .","0"
biology," A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus ( plural = nucleoli ) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm .","1"
biology," 178 . Peroxisomes are small , round organelles enclosed by single membranes .","1"
biology," They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids .","0"
biology," 181 . Animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells : lysosomes .","0"
biology," The lysosomes are the cell ’s “ garbage disposal . ”","1"
biology," In plant cells , the digestive processes take place in vacuoles .","0"
biology," Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins , polysaccharides , lipids , nucleic acids , and even worn - out organelles .","0"
biology," 184 . The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll , which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis .","1"
biology," Like plant cells , photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts .","0"
biology," 187 . MicrofilamentsOf the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton , microfilaments are the narrowest .","0"
biology," They function in cellular movement , have a diameter of about 7 nm , and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 190 . To refresh your memory , flagella ( singular = flagellum ) are long , hair - like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell ( for example , sperm , Euglena ) .","1"
biology," When present , the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella .","0"
biology," 193 . Such transport uses the vascular tissues ( xylem and phloem ) primarily .","0"
biology," There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata ( singular = plasmodesma ) , numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells , connect their cytoplasm , and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell , and thus throughout the plant ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells .","0"
biology," Plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell .","0"
biology," 196 . Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions , nutrients , and other substances that enable cells to communicate ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Structurally , however , gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ .","0"
biology," 199 . The main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic , phospholipid molecules .","0"
biology," The hydrophilic or “ water - loving ” areas of these molecules ( which look like a collection of balls in an artist ’s rendition of the model ) ( [ link ] ) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell .","1"
biology," Hydrophobic , or water - hating molecules , tend to be non - polar .","1"
biology," 202 . Proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes .","0"
biology," Integral proteins ( some specialized types are called integrins ) are , as their name suggests , integrated completely into the membrane structure , and their hydrophobic membrane - spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Single - pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20 – 25 amino acids .","0"
biology," 205 . The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive .","0"
biology," Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement .","1"
biology," In passive transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration .","0"
biology," 208 . In filtration , material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane ; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure , causing the substances to filter more rapidly .","1"
biology," This occurs in the kidney , where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances , or solutes , out of the blood and into the renal tubules .","1"
biology," The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure .","0"
biology," 211 . Channels are specific for the substance that is being transported .","0"
biology," Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids ; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell .","0"
biology," 214 . Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane , which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes .","1"
biology," While diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells , osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water .","0"
biology," 217 . A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .","0"
biology," Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution .","1"
biology," A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles ; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles .","0"
biology," 220 . In an isotonic solution , the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell .","1"
biology," If the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid , there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell , although water will still move in and out .","0"
biology," 223 . The electrical gradient of K+ , a positive ion , also tends to drive it into the cell , but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+ out of the cell ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient .","1"
biology," 226 . Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .","1"
biology," Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .","1"
biology," 229 . A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .","1"
biology," A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .","1"
biology," An antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules , but in different directions .","1"
biology," 232 . Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles , such as large molecules , parts of cells , and even whole cells , into a cell .","1"
biology," There are different variations of endocytosis , but all share a common characteristic : The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates , forming a pocket around the target particle .","0"
biology," 235 . A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis .","0"
biology," This process uses a coating protein , called caveolin , on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane , which performs a similar function to clathrin .","1"
biology," 238 . The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis .","0"
biology," Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid .","1"
biology," Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane .","0"
biology," 241 . Anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones .","1"
biology," Synthesizing sugar from CO2 is one example .","0"
biology," 244 . In most cases , this form is heat energy .","0"
biology," Thermodynamically , heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work .","1"
biology," For example , when an airplane flies through the air , some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air .","0"
biology," 247 . If it is released , indeed it would do work .","0"
biology," Because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work , it is called potential energy .","0"
biology," Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way : As the wrecking ball hangs motionless , it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy .","0"
biology," 250 . To calculate ∆G , subtract the amount of energy lost to entropy ( denoted as ∆S ) from the total energy change of the system .","0"
biology," This total energy change in the system is called enthalpy and is denoted as ∆H .","0"
biology," The formula for calculating ∆G is as follows , where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in Kelvin ( degrees Celsius + 273 ) :","0"
biology," 253 . These reactions have a net release of energy , but still require some energy in the beginning .","1"
biology," This small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy ( or free energy of activation ) and is abbreviated EA ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 256 . Within the cell , where does energy to power such reactions come from ?","0"
biology," The answer lies with an energy - supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate , or ATP .","0"
biology," ATP is a small , relatively simple molecule ( [ link ] ) , but within some of its bonds , it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work .","1"
biology," 259 . Two reactants might also enter a reaction , both become modified , and leave the reaction as two products .","0"
biology," The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme ’s active site .","1"
biology," The active site is where the “ action ” happens , so to speak .","0"
biology," 262 . In some cases of enzyme inhibition , for example , an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding .","0"
biology," When this happens , the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition , because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," On the other hand , in noncompetitive inhibition , an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site .","1"
biology," 265 . In a most efficient and elegant way , cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity .","0"
biology," Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions .","0"
biology," 268 . This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group , with its energy , to the substrate , a process called phosphorylation .","0"
biology," Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate ( ~P ) .","1"
biology," This is illustrated by the following generic reaction :","0"
biology," 271 . Chemiosmosis , a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight .","1"
biology," The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process .","1"
biology," 274 . The other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins , also known as glucose transporter proteins .","0"
biology," These transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose . Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring - shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three - carbon sugar called pyruvate .","1"
biology," Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases .","0"
biology," 277 . There , pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A ( CoA ) .","0"

biology," 280 . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( [ link ] ) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids .","1"
biology," However , these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER : the rough ER and the smooth ER , respectively .","0"
biology," 283 . Before reaching their final destination , the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted , packaged , and tagged so that they wind up in the right place .","0"
biology," Sorting , tagging , packaging , and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus ( also called the Golgi body ) , a series of flattened membranes ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 286 . Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism .","0"
biology," Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT proteins that transport glucose ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Different forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues .","0"
biology," 289 . The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago . Plants , algae , and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Because they use light to manufacture their own food , they are called photoautotrophs ( literally , “ self - feeders using light ” ) .","1"
biology," Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .","0"
biology," 292 . In plants , photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves , which consist of several layers of cells .","0"
biology," The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll .","1"
biology," The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance .","0"
biology," 295 . Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope ( composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane ) .","0"
biology," Within the chloroplast are stacked , disc - shaped structures called thylakoids .","0"
biology," Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .","1"
biology," 298 . The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .","0"
biology," As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis ) .","1"

biology," The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves .","1"
biology," Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength , the distance between consecutive points of a wave .","1"
biology," A single wave is measured from two consecutive points , such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 304 . The carotenoids found in fruit — such as the red of tomato ( lycopene ) , the yellow of corn seeds ( zeaxanthin ) , or the orange of an orange peel ( β - carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers .","0"
biology," In photosynthesis , carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy .","0"
biology," When a leaf is exposed to full sun , the light - dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy ; if that energy is not handled properly , it can do significant damage .","0"
biology," 310 . Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids .","0"
biology," The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “ packet ” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state .","0"
biology," In short , the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet .","0"
biology," 313 . The reaction center of PSII ( called P680 ) delivers its high - energy electrons , one at the time , to the primary electron acceptor , and through the electron transport chain ( Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine ) to PSI .","1"
biology," P680 ’s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low - energy electron from water ; thus , water is split and PSII is re - reduced after every photoact .","0"
biology," 316 . The number of carbon atoms remains the same , as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions ( 3 atoms from 3CO2 + 15 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of 3-PGA ) .","1"
biology," This process is called carbon fixation , because CO2 is “ fixed ” from an inorganic form into organic molecules .","0"
biology," 319 . Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .","1"
biology," An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands .","0"
biology," A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , delivering a signal in the process .","1"
biology," 322 . Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals .","1"
biology," Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix .","0"
biology," 325 . When these impulses reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell ( the cell emitting the signal ) .","0"
biology," The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells , which are called chemical synapses ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly ; this enables an immediate response , such as , Take your hand off the stove !","0"
biology," 328 . Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells .","1"
biology," These water - filled channels allow small signaling molecules , called intracellular mediators , to diffuse between the two cells .","0"
biology," Small molecules , such as calcium ions ( Ca2 + ) , are able to move between cells , but large molecules like proteins and DNA can not fit through the channels .","0"
biology," 331 . Each cell - surface receptor has three main components : an external ligand - binding domain , a hydrophobic membrane - spanning region , and an intracellular domain inside the cell .","0"
biology," The ligand - binding domain is also called the extracellular domain .","0"
biology," The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely , depending on the type of receptor .","0"
biology," 334 . Enzyme - linked receptors are cell - surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme .","1"
biology," In some cases , the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme .","0"
biology," 337 . In some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .","1"
biology," A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .","1"
biology," The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other .","0"
biology," 340 . Phosphates are also often added to serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues of proteins , where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase .","1"
biology," Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate .","0"
biology," 343 . Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP - dependent kinase ( A - kinase ) .","0"
biology," A - kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways : It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins , activating them in the process .","1"
biology," 346 . The second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor .","0"
biology," An inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function .","1"
biology," In this case , the inhibitor is a protein called Iκ - B , which binds to the regulatory protein NF - κB .","0"
biology," 349 . Inside the cell , many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades .","0"
biology," For example , phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation .","1"
biology," Cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase , and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca2 + pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell .","0"
biology," 352 . When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level , specific gene expression is initiated , and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light .","0"
biology," Because the number of cells present in the environment ( cell density ) is the determining factor for signaling , bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing .","1"
biology," In politics and business , a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue .","1"
biology," 355 . Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate , a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a cell ’s genetic information is necessary .","0"
biology," A cell ’s DNA , packaged as a double - stranded DNA molecule , is called its genome .","1"
biology," In prokaryotes , the genome is composed of a single , double - stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 358 . The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is designated 2n .","0"
biology," Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called gametes , or sex cells ; these are eggs and sperm , and are designated 1n , or haploid . There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell .","1"
biology," The condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus ( top ) , removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide ( right ) , and artificially arranged according to length ( left ) ; an arrangement like this is called a karyotype .","1"
biology," 361 . In the first level of compaction , short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The DNA - histone complex is called chromatin .","0"
biology," 364 . When fully compact , the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins .","0"
biology," The connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere .","1"
biology," The conjoined sister chromatids , with a diameter of about 1 µm , are visible under a light microscope .","0"
biology," 367 . During interphase , the cell grows and DNA is replicated .","1"
biology," During the mitotic phase , the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated , and the cell divides .","1"
biology," 370 . The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase .","1"
biology," The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle , the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis .","1"
biology," At the center of each animal cell , the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod - like objects , the centrioles , which are at right angles to each other .","1"
biology," 373 . The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned , separated , and move into two new , identical daughter cells .","1"
biology," The first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis , or nuclear division .","1"
biology," The second portion of the mitotic phase , called cytokinesis , is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells . Link to Learning","1"
biology," 376 . Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes , pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen .","0"
biology," The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become visible under a light microscope .","0"
biology," 379 . During metaphase , the “ change phase , ” all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate , or the equatorial plane , midway between the two poles of the cell .","1"
biology," The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins .","0"
biology," 382 . Cytokinesis , or “ cell motion , ” is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells .","1"
biology," Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells .","0"
biology," 385 . Not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase , closely followed by the mitotic phase .","0"
biology," Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide .","0"
biology," The cell is in a quiescent ( inactive ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle .","1"
biology," 388 . The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .","1"
biology," Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .","1"
biology," Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene .","0"
biology," 391 . Two groups of proteins , called cyclins and cyclin - dependent kinases ( Cdks ) , are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints .","1"
biology," The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 394 . The packing proteins of bacteria are , however , related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes . The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell .","0"
biology," The starting point of replication , the origin , is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Replication of the DNA is bidirectional , moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously .","0"
biology," 397 . Sexual reproduction requires fertilization , the union of two cells from two individual organisms .","1"
biology," If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes , then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes .","0"
biology," 403 . During DNA duplication in the S phase , each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies , called sister chromatids , that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins . Cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase II .","1"
biology," 406 . The synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non - sister homologous chromatids , a process called crossing over .","1"
biology," Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata ( singular = chiasma ) ( [ link]).In species such as humans , even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous ( most of their genes differ ) , they have a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I .","0"
biology," A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology .","0"
biology," 409 . Following crossover , the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed .","0"
biology," At the end of prophase I , the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ( [ link ] ) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible .","1"
biology," 412 . Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles .","0"
biology," What happens between these two events depends on the organism .","0"
biology," 415 . Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle .","0"
biology," The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes , because they produce gametes from specialized cells .","1"
biology," Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case , because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid .","0"
biology," 418 . In 1866 , he published his work , Experiments in Plant Hybridization,1 in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn . Mendel ’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed , incorrectly , that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring ; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation .","0"
biology," Continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height .","1"
biology," Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents ’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .","0"
biology," 421 . Mendel performed hybridizations , which involve mating two true - breeding individuals that have different traits .","1"
biology," In the pea , which is naturally self - pollinating , this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety .","0"
biology," 424 . Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .","0"
biology," He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2 , or second filial , generation .","0"
biology," Mendel ’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4 generations , and so on , but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel ’s postulates . In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns , Mendel crossed plants that were true - breeding for violet flower color with plants true - breeding for white flower color ( the P generation ) .","0"
biology," 427 . He called these , respectively , dominant and recessive traits .","0"
biology," Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization .","1"
biology," Recessive traits become latent , or disappear , in the offspring of a hybridization .","1"
biology," 430 . On the other hand , the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway .","0"
biology," The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event , of two mutually exclusive events , is the sum of their individual probabilities .","1"
biology," 433 . The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .","1"
biology," An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .","1"
biology," Mendel ’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype .","0"
biology," 436 . When fertilization occurs between two true - breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic , the process is called a monohybrid cross , and the resulting offspring are monohybrids .","1"
biology," Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic .","0"
biology," 439 . Of course , doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical .","0"
biology," Instead , geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 442 . Although individual humans ( and all diploid organisms ) can only have two alleles for a given gene , multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed .","0"
biology," Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .","1"
biology," All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .","0"
biology," 445 . Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis , the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes .","0"
biology," When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome , but not on the Y chromosome , it is said to be X - linked .","1"
biology," 448 . For instance , the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote . A single copy of the wild - type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival .","0"
biology," The dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote ; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age .","1"
biology," Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form .","0"
biology," 451 . Mendel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .","1"
biology," The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .","0"
biology," 454 . In epistasis , the interaction between genes is antagonistic , such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another .","1"
biology," “ Epistasis ” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “ standing upon . ” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking .","0"
biology," 457 . If the genes are unlinked , the individual should produce AB , Ab , aB , and ab gametes with equal frequencies , according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment .","1"
biology," Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .","1"
biology," Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .","1"
biology," 460 . Such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked , but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur .","0"
biology," Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units , or centimorgans ( cM ) , in which a recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM .","1"
biology," By representing alleles in a linear map , Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked ( recombination frequency = 0 ) to being perfectly unlinked ( recombination frequency = 0.5 ) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome .","0"
biology," Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross .","0"
biology," 463 . In a given species , chromosomes can be identified by their number , size , centromere position , and banding pattern .","0"
biology," In a human karyotype , autosomes or “ body chromosomes ” ( all of the non – sex chromosomes ) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest ( chromosome 1 ) to smallest ( chromosome 22 ) .","1"
biology," The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes .","0"
biology," 466 . An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .","1"
biology," An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .","1"
biology," 469 . Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes , variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects .","0"
biology," In part , this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation .","0"
biology," Early in development , when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells ( relative to trillions in the newborn ) , one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent ( dormant ) structure called a Barr body .","1"
biology," 472 . A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different , nonhomologous chromosome .","1"
biology," Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences .","0"
biology," 475 . The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site .","0"
biology," An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs .","1"
biology," ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .","0"
biology," 478 . The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end .","0"
biology," Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .","1"
biology," Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .","0"
biology," 481 . This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .","0"
biology," The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .","1"
biology," Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .","0"
biology," 484 . The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .","1"
biology," Topoisomerase prevents the over - winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up ; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it .","1"
biology," As synthesis proceeds , the RNA primers are replaced by DNA .","0"
biology," 487 . Some errors are not corrected during replication , but are instead corrected after replication is completed ; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it ; this is then replaced by the correct base .","0"
biology," 490 . Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .","0"
biology," Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .","1"
biology," Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .","1"
biology," 493 . Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .","1"
biology," Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .","1"
biology," The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions , in which one base is replaced by another .","1"
biology," 496 . The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres , which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene .","1"
biology," In a way , these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide .","0"
biology," 499 . The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence .","0"
biology," However , the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear , such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1 , nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2 , and so on . Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA .","0"
biology," Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein .","1"
biology," 502 . These nucleotide triplets are called codons .","1"
biology," The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation , the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained .","0"
biology," 505 . Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .","0"
biology," The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble .","1"
biology," Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene , which is called the template strand .","1"
biology," The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand , called the nontemplate strand .","1"
biology," 508 . The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site , or the initiation site .","1"
biology," Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .","0"
biology," Conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “ + ” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides .","1"
biology," 511 . Without σ , the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish .","0"
biology," The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme .","1"
biology," 514 . One is protein - based and the other is RNA - based .","0"
biology," Rho - dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein , which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain .","1"
biology," Near the end of the gene , the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls .","0"
biology," 517 . RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus .","0"
biology," This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre - rRNA , transfer pre - RNAs ( pre - tRNAs ) , and small nuclear pre - RNAs .","0"
biology," The tRNAs have a critical role in translation ; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain .","0"
biology," 520 . Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed .","0"
biology," Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation .","1"
biology," 523 . The corresponding amino acid must be added later , once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm .","0"
biology," Through the process of tRNA “ charging , ” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases .","1"
biology," At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids ; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species .","0"
biology," 526 . Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG , but this is not always the case .","0"
biology," According to Kozak ’s rules , the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon .","1"
biology," Kozak ’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes : 5'-gccRccAUGG-3 ' .","0"
biology," 529 . Usually , this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides .","0"
biology," The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this .","0"
biology," 532 . Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons , which correspond to protein - coding sequences ( ex - on signifies that they are expressed ) , and intervening sequences called introns ( int - ron denotes their intervening role ) , which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre - mRNA during processing .","1"
biology," Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins .","0"
biology," 535 . All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA .","0"
biology," The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression .","1"
biology," Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi - cellular organism , each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed .","0"
biology," 538 . In prokaryotic cells , there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons : repressors , activators , and inducers .","0"
biology," Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus , whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus .","1"
biology," Finally , inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate .","1"
biology," 541 . The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon .","0"
biology," Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site .","0"
biology," This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription .","1"
biology," 544 . Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules , there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them .","0"
biology," For example , when glucose is scarce , E .","0"
biology," 547 . One such sugar source is lactose .","0"
biology," The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment .","1"
biology," CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon .","1"
biology," 550 . When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .","1"
biology," The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .","1"
biology," Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed .","0"
biology," 553 . The 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) .","1"
biology," The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .","1"
biology," Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm , the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled .","0"
biology," 556 . Rather , these are regions that regulate mRNA localization , stability , and protein translation .","0"
biology," The region just before the protein - coding region is called the 5 ' UTR , whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3 ' UTR ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule , depending on the specific RBP that binds .","0"
biology," 559 . These pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .","0"
biology," Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .","1"
biology," RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA .","0"
biology," 562 . The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .","1"
biology," The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .","0"
biology," GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .","0"
biology," 565 . At this point , when the initiator complex is assembled , the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released .","0"
biology," The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA .","0"
biology," The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation .","0"
biology," 568 . An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc .","0"
biology," Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett ’s Lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph system .","1"
biology," Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably .","0"
biology," 571 . Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .","1"
biology," Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .","1"
biology," The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol .","0"
biology," 574 . Nucleic acid samples , such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts , can be probed for the presence of certain sequences .","0"
biology," Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection .","1"
biology," Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size .","1"
biology," 577 . Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation .","0"
biology," In the bacterial context , the fragment of DNA from the human genome ( or the genome of another organism that is being studied ) is referred to as foreign DNA , or a transgene , to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium , which is called the host DNA .","1"
biology," 580 . The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .","0"
biology," Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner ; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA .","1"
biology," Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA , such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single - stranded overhang .","0"
biology," 583 . Unicellular organisms , such as bacteria and yeast , naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission ; this is known as cellular cloning .","1"
biology," The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis , which creates an exact replica of the genetic material .","0"
biology," 586 . The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .","0"
biology," The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) .","1"
biology," If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic .","1"
biology," 589 . The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing .","1"
biology," Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease - causing gene , family members are advised to undergo genetic testing .","0"
biology," 592 . Genomics is the study of entire genomes , including the complete set of genes , their nucleotide sequence and organization , and their interactions within a species and with other species .","1"
biology," Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome .","1"
biology," 595 . Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .","0"
biology," A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co - segregates ( shows genetic linkage ) with a specific trait .","1"
biology," Early geneticists called this linkage analysis .","0"
biology," 598 . For example , in experiments performed on the garden pea , it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant ’s pollen were linked traits , and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome .","0"
biology," The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination , which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA , such as nonsister chromatids .","1"
biology," Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes .","1"
biology," 601 . It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .","0"
biology," Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation , such as x - rays , to break the DNA into fragments .","1"
biology," The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments .","0"
biology," 604 . A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology ( a sequence - tagged site , or STS ) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location .","0"
biology," An expressed sequence tag ( EST ) and a single sequence length polymorphism ( SSLP ) are common STSs .","0"
biology," An EST is a short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries , while SSLPs are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps .","1"
biology," 607 . The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single - stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide ( dNTP ) , which is a monomer , or a single unit , of DNA .","0"
biology," The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ( ddNTPs ) .","0"
biology," The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group ( – OH ) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 610 . This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes .","0"
biology," However , the desire to sequence larger genomes , such as that of a human , led to the development of double - barrel shotgun sequencing , more formally known as pairwise - end sequencing .","0"
biology," In pairwise - end sequencing , both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap .","1"
biology," 613 . Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms .","0"
biology," The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation .","1"
biology," Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology , such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets .","0"
biology," 616 . Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction , not all mRNAs are translated into proteins .","0"
biology," The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics .","1"
biology," Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes .","0"
biology," 622 . Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries .","0"
biology," Most of the common diseases , such as heart disease , are multi - factored or polygenic , which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes , and also involve environmental factors such as diet .","1"
biology," In April 2010 , scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual ( Stephen Quake , a scientist at Stanford University , who had his genome sequenced ) ; the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases .","0"
biology," 628 . A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation .","1"
biology," Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “ fit ” of the population to its environment .","0"
biology," 631 . Over time , evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species , but they have maintained the same overall layout .","1"
biology," Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures .","0"
biology," 637 . A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile , viable offspring .","1"
biology," According to this definition , one species is distinguished from another when , in nature , it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring .","0"
biology," 640 . Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories .","0"
biology," Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution .","1"
biology," Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location .","1"
biology," 643 . Over time , the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species .","1"
biology," This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin ; thus , causing the species to radiate into several new ones .","0"
biology," Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms .","0"
biology," 646 . Given enough time , the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction : if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together , mating would be less likely , but if mating occurred , offspring would be non - viable or infertile .","0"
biology," Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation , the ability to interbreed , of the two populations .","1"
biology," 649 . Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year , often just annually .","0"
biology," Differences in breeding schedules , called temporal isolation , can act as a form of reproductive isolation .","1"
biology," For example , two species of frogs inhabit the same area , but one reproduces from January to March , whereas the other reproduces from March to May ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation .","0"
biology," 652 . Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells ( eggs and sperm ) prevent fertilization from taking place ; this is called a gametic barrier .","1"
biology," Similarly , in some cases closely related organisms try to mate , but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together .","0"
biology," 655 . In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .","1"
biology," The theory also connects this change of a population over time , called microevolution , with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters , called macroevolution .","1"
biology," 658 . Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way , meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele , while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool .","0"
biology," The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population .","1"
biology," 661 . Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic .","1"
biology," The distribution of phenotypes among individuals , known as the population variation , is influenced by a number of factors , including the population ’s genetic structure and the environment ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures .","0"
biology," 664 . When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .","0"
biology," This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding , the mating of closely related individuals , which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease .","1"
biology," For example , a disease that is caused by a rare , recessive allele might exist in a population , but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele .","0"
biology," 667 . Another way a population ’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift ( [ link ] ) , which is simply the effect of chance .","0"
biology," By chance , some individuals will have more offspring than others — not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically - encoded trait , but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time ( when the receptive female walked by ) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ( when a fox was hunting ) .","1"
biology," 670 . If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers , the result can be a changing population .","0"
biology," There are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs .","0"
biology," One reason is simple mate choice ; for example , female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger , brighter tails .","0"
biology," 673 . Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .","0"
biology," One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .","1"
biology," Species of warm - blooded animals , for example , tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth ’s poles , allowing them to better conserve heat .","0"
biology," 676 . However , it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts , but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population .","1"
biology," This concept , called relative fitness , allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation , and thus , how the population might evolve .","0"
biology," 679 . Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection , while the intermediate phenotypes are , on average , less fit .","1"
biology," Known as diversifying selection ( [ link ] ) , this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms .","0"
biology," Large , dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force , while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male ’s territory .","0"
biology," 682 . The speculation is that large tails carry risk , and only the best males survive that risk : the bigger the tail , the more fit the male .","0"
biology," This idea is known as the handicap principle .","0"
biology," 685 . In scientific terms , the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny .","1"
biology," A phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism , such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved , to which species it is most closely related , and so forth .","0"
biology," 688 . In a rooted tree , the branching indicates evolutionary relationships ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .","1"
biology," A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .","1"
biology," 691 . When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .","1"
biology," A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .","1"
biology," It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor , it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other .","0"
biology," 694 . For example , after the common beginning of all life , scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain : Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya .","1"
biology," Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .","1"
biology," After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 697 . Therefore , the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus .","0"
biology," The name at each level is also called a taxon .","1"
biology," In other words , dogs are in order Carnivora .","0"
biology," 700 . How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees ?","0"
biology," After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted , scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics .","0"
biology," This system sorts organisms into clades : groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor .","1"
biology," 703 . Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure .","0"
biology," Only some of the organisms in [ link ] have this trait , and to those that do , it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree .","1"
biology," The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative .","0"
biology," The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used .","0"
biology," 706 . More recently , a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered .","0"
biology," Small , virus - like particles called gene transfer agents ( GTAs ) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another .","1"
biology," GTAs have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes , sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes .","0"
biology," 709 . The nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link ] a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .","1"
biology," The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link ] b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .","1"
biology," Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link ] c ) .","1"
biology," 712 . Others have proposed abandoning any tree - like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure , the so - called “ ring of life ” ( [ link ] ) ; a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes .","1"
biology," Lake , again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm , proposes a ring - like model in which species of all three domains — Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya — evolved from a single pool of gene - swapping prokaryotes .","1"
biology," 715 . They therefore lack most of the components of cells , such as organelles , ribosomes , and the plasma membrane .","0"
biology," A virion consists of a nucleic acid core , an outer protein coating or capsid , and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell .","1"
biology," Viruses may also contain additional proteins , such as enzymes .","0"
biology," 718 . Many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," For these viruses , attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane , so they can complete their replication inside the cell .","0"
biology," 721 . Group I viruses contain double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) as their genome .","0"
biology," Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .","0"
biology," 724 . The strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .","0"
biology," Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .","0"
biology," Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .","0"
biology," 727 . Multiple , full - length RNA strands of negative polarity ( complimentary to the positive - stranded genomic RNA ) are formed from these intermediates , which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity , including both full - length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs .","0"
biology," Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity , meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mRNA .","0"
biology," As with Group IV viruses , dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mRNA .","0"
biology," 730 . Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host .","0"
biology," Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive .","1"
biology," For most viruses , the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach .","0"
biology," 733 . The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .","0"
biology," Many animal viruses , such as HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) , leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding , where virions leave the cell individually .","1"
biology," During the budding process , the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed .","0"
biology," 736 . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .","1"
biology," If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 739 . For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .","1"
biology," When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .","1"
biology," An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the λ ( lambda ) virus , which also infects the E .","0"
biology," 742 . As you will learn in the next module , animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases .","0"
biology," Some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease , where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection .","1"
biology," Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .","0"
biology," 745 . Some animal - infecting viruses , including the hepatitis C virus discussed above , are known as oncogenic viruses : They have the ability to cause cancer .","1"
biology," These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth ( oncogenes ) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth .","1"
biology," 748 . One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .","1"
biology," Other viruses induce hypoplasia , or decreased cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear .","1"
biology," Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells , a process known as cell necrosis .","1"
biology," 751 . The danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .","0"
biology," Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .","0"
biology," 754 . Another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect .","0"
biology," Oncolytic viruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells .","1"
biology," A genetically modified adenovirus known as H101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck cancers .","0"
biology," 757 . Prions , so - called because they are proteinaceous , are infectious particles — smaller than viruses — that contain no nucleic acids ( neither DNA nor RNA ) .","1"
biology," Historically , the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible , but pioneering work by Nobel Prize - winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents do indeed exist .","0"
biology," 760 . Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things .","0"
biology," Prokaryotes recycle nutrients — essential substances ( such as carbon and nitrogen ) — and they drive the evolution of new ecosystems , some of which are natural and others man - made .","1"
biology," Prokaryotes have been on Earth since long before multicellular life appeared .","0"
biology," 766 . Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .","1"
biology," Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .","1"
biology," Then , cyanobacteria , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later .","0"
biology," 769 . For example , a soda lake is both salty and alkaline , so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Other extremophiles , like radioresistant organisms , do not prefer an extreme environment ( in this case , one with high levels of radiation ) , but have adapted to survive in it ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 772 . This model , however , does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes , most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact .","0"
biology," A biofilm is a microbial community ( [ link ] ) held together in a gummy - textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms , together with some proteins and nucleic acids .","1"
biology," Biofilms grow attached to surfaces .","0"
biology," 775 . Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan , composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross - linked by unusual peptides containing both L - and D - amino acids including D - glutamic acid and D - alanine .","1"
biology," Proteins normally have only L - amino acids ; as a consequence , many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D - amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development .","0"
biology," 778 . Gram - positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram - negative organisms ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Up to 90 percent of the cell wall in Gram - positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan , and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids .","0"
biology," Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids .","0"
biology," 781 . If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome , it too may become pathogenic .","0"
biology," In transduction , bacteriophages , the viruses that infect bacteria , sometimes also move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another .","1"
biology," Transduction results in a recombinant organism .","0"
biology," 787 . The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air , but this nitrogen is not usable by plants , which are primary producers .","0"
biology," Gaseous nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation .","1"
biology," Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . Another source of ammonia is ammonification , the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen - containing organic compounds .","1"
biology," 790 . Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas , Nitrobacter , and Nitrospira .","0"
biology," The bacteria performs the reverse process , the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O , NO , and N2 , a process called denitrification .","1"

biology," The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks .","0"
biology," 1540 . This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .","0"
biology," This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells , causing high levels of blood glucose , or hyperglycemia ( high sugar ) .","1"
biology," High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine , resulting in glucose being lost in urine .","0"
biology," 1543 . When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels , for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise , the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas .","0"
biology," Glucagon raises blood glucose levels , eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect , by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis .","1"

biology," This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way ( such as tags , bands , paint , or other body markings ) , and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population ; later , a new sample is collected , including some individuals that are marked ( recaptures ) and some individuals that are unmarked ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 1990 . Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve , which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time ( usually with data compiled from a life table ) .","1"
biology," These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations ( [ link ] ) .","0"

biology," When the population size , N , is plotted over time , a J - shaped growth curve is produced ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited .","0"
biology," Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .","0"

biology," The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential , or rmax , thus changing the equation to :","0"
biology," 2005 . While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration , other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten , even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals .","0"
biology," In Batesian mimicry , a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one .","1"
biology," Assuming they share the same predators , this coloration then protects the harmless ones , even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic .","0"
biology," 2008 . All species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem , which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community .","1"
biology," The competitive exclusion principle states that two species can not occupy the same niche in a habitat .","1"
biology," In other words , different species can not coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources .","0"
biology," 2011 . A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism , where two species benefit from their interaction .","1"

biology," 2023 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .","1"
biology," Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .","1"
biology," 2026 . One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors , which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences , from the learned behaviors , which result from environmental conditioning .","1"
biology," Innate behavior , or instinct , is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned .","0"
biology," 2029 . A similar , but more directed version of kinesis is taxis : the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus .","1"
biology," This movement can be in response to light ( phototaxis ) , chemical signals ( chemotaxis ) , or gravity ( geotaxis ) and can be directed toward ( positive ) or away ( negative ) from the source of the stimulus .","0"

biology," Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors , and these are favored by natural section .","1"
biology," 2038 . Significant energy is spent in the process of locating , attracting , and mating with the sex partner .","0"
biology," Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics : intersexual selection , the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex , and intrasexual selection , the competition for mates between species members of the same sex .","1"
biology," Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual , aural , tactile , and chemical cues .","0"
biology," 2041 . In polyandrous mating systems , one female mates with many males .","1"

biology," In other words , fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible , repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring .","0"
biology," 2053 . Additionally , populations do not usually exist in isolation .","0"
biology," They engage in interspecific competition : that is , they share the environment with other species , competing with them for the same resources .","1"
biology," These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow .","0"
biology," 2056 . In contrast , r - selected species have a large number of small offspring ( hence their r designation ( [ link ] ) .","0"

biology," In ecology , a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass : primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics .","1"
biology," There is a single path through the chain .","0"
biology," 2068 . Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .","1"
biology," Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .","1"

biology," 2071 . A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .","1"
biology," A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .","1"

biology," A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .","1"
biology," Ideally , these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances , and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers ( such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists ) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health .","0"
biology," 2086 . One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification .","0"
biology," Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent , toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level , from the primary producers to the apex consumers .","1"

biology," The Nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids , driving species after species to the point of extinction ( the disappearance of a species ) .","0"
biology," In fact , there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria : the Nile perch , declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria , and increased fishing pressure .","0"
biology," 2101 . It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity , meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area ( [ link ] ) .","1"

biology," Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species .","1"
biology," The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts , a kind of conservation triage .","0"
biology," 2107 . A second approach to estimating present - time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest - area loss and understanding species - area relationships .","0"

biology," 0 . What is biology ?","0"
biology," In simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments .","1"
biology," This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast .","0"
biology," 3 . The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later , but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments .","0"
biology," A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be tested .","1"
biology," Although using the scientific method is inherent to science , it is inadequate in determining what science is .","0"
biology," 6 . For some experts , the natural sciences are astronomy , biology , chemistry , earth science , and physics .","0"
biology," Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences , which study living things and include biology , and physical sciences , which study nonliving matter and include astronomy , geology , physics , and chemistry .","1"
biology," Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary .","0"
biology," 9 . Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study : descriptive science and hypothesis - based science .","0"
biology," Descriptive ( or discovery ) science , which is usually inductive , aims to observe , explore , and discover , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually deductive , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested . The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred , and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches .","1"
biology," 18 . The introduction starts with brief , but broad , background information about what is known in the field .","1"
biology," A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work ; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper , where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented .","0"
biology," 21 . Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section , but it is more common to combine both .","0"
biology," If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections , the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation .","1"
biology," The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .","0"
biology," 27 . Atoms form molecules .","0"
biology," A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .","1"
biology," Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .","1"
biology," 30 . Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts , which carry out indispensable functions : mitochondria produce energy to power the cell , while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars .","0"
biology," All living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms .","1"
biology," ( This requirement is why viruses are not considered living : they are not made of cells .","0"
biology," 33 . In larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions .","1"
biology," Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function .","1"
biology," Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .","0"
biology," 36 . All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population .","1"

biology," Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions .","1"
biology," There are 118 elements , but only 92 occur naturally .","0"
biology," 51 . Although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge .","0"
biology," A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged .","0"
biology," Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .","0"
biology," 54 . The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .","0"
biology," Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’s mass number , as illustrated in [ link ] .","1"
biology," Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number .","0"
biology," 63 . The group 18 atoms helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , and argon ( Ar ) all have filled outer electron shells , making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms .","0"
biology," Their non - reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases ( or noble gases ) .","0"
biology," Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left - hand column .","0"
biology," 66 . Two electrons fill the 1s orbital , and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital .","0"
biology," Its electron configuration is 1s22s1 .","0"
biology," Neon ( Ne ) , on the other hand , has a total of ten electrons : two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell ( two each in the 2s and three p orbitals ) ; thus , it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms .","0"
biology," 69 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .","0"
biology," The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .","1"
biology," An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction ; this direction is not always a “ one - way street . ”","0"
biology," For the creation of the water molecule shown above , the chemical equation would be :","0"
biology," 72 . Some chemical reactions , such as the one shown above , can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up .","0"
biology," The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .","0"
biology," Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .","0"
biology," 84 . Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally .","1"
biology," For example , molecular oxygen ( O2 ) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms .","0"
biology," 87 . Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions .","0"
biology," A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -philic = “ loving ” ) .","1"
biology," In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .","0"
biology," 90 . Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .","1"
biology," For water , this amount is one calorie .","0"
biology," It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool .","0"
biology," 93 . Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it .","0"
biology," Therefore , water is referred to as a solvent , a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds .","1"
biology," The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .","0"
biology," 96 . Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension , the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress .","1"
biology," This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity .","0"

biology," You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated .","0"
biology," 102 . The pH scale is , as previously mentioned , an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Anything below 7.0 ( ranging from 0.0 to 6.9 ) is acidic , and anything above 7.0 ( from 7.1 to 14.0 ) is alkaline .","0"
biology," 105 . Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen , such as methane ( CH4 ) described above .","1"
biology," We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels — like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter .","0"
biology," 108 . The three - dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry .","0"
biology," Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .","1"
biology," Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .","1"
biology," 111 . Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three - dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images .","1"
biology," As shown in [ link ] , an amino acid alanine example , the two structures are non - superimposable .","0"
biology," 114 . As you ’ve learned , biological macromolecules are large molecules , necessary for life , that are built from smaller organic molecules .","1"
biology," There are four major classes of biological macromolecules ( carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids ) ; each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions .","0"
biology," 120 . Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula ( CH2O ) n , where n is the number of carbons in the molecule .","0"

biology," Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure .","0"
biology," Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .","0"
biology," 132 . Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond .","0"
biology," If hydrogens are present in the same plane , it is referred to as a cis fat ; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes , it is referred to as a trans fat .","0"
biology," The cis double bond causes a bend or a “ kink ” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly , keeping them liquid at room temperature ( [ link ] ) .","0"

biology," Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure , which consists of a central carbon atom , also known as the alpha ( α ) carbon , bonded to an amino group ( NH2 ) , a carboxyl group ( COOH ) , and to a hydrogen atom .","0"
biology," 144 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .","0"
biology," The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 147 . In nature , some proteins are formed from several polypeptides , also known as subunits , and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure .","0"
biology," Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure .","0"
biology," 150 . The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) .","0"
biology," DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms , ranging from single - celled bacteria to multicellular mammals .","1"
biology," 153 . DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides .","0"
biology," The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide , DNA or RNA .","0"
biology," Each nucleotide is made up of three components : a nitrogenous base , a pentose ( five - carbon ) sugar , and a phosphate group ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 156 . The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , and 5′ ( 1′ is read as “ one prime ” ) .","0"
biology," The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide , which forms a 5′–3′ phosphodiester linkage .","0"
biology," The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules : its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups .","0"
biology," 159 . As you have learned , information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein .","0"
biology," DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as transcription , and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation .","1"
biology," This is known as the Central Dogma of Life , which holds true for all organisms ; however , exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections .","0"
biology," 162 . In contrast to light microscopes , electron microscopes ( [ link ] b ) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light .","1"
biology," Not only does this allow for higher magnification and , thus , more detail ( [ link ] ) , it also provides higher resolving power .","0"
biology," 165 . We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes .","0"

biology," Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers .","0"
biology," 174 . When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle , proteins are attached to chromosomes , and they resemble an unwound , jumbled bunch of threads .","0"
biology," These unwound protein - chromosome complexes are called chromatin ( [ link ] ) ; chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed .","1"
biology," 177 . Mitochondria ( singular = mitochondrion ) are often called the “ powerhouses ” or “ energy factories ” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the cell ’s main energy - carrying molecule .","0"
biology," ATP represents the short - term stored energy of the cell .","1"
biology," 180 . The centrosome is a microtubule - organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells .","1"

biology," 186 . Within the cytoplasm , there would still be ions and organic molecules , plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell , secure some organelles in specific positions , allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell , and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move .","1"
biology," Collectively , this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton .","0"
biology," There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton : microfilaments , intermediate filaments , and microtubules ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 189 . The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of α - tubulin and β - tubulin , two globular proteins ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," With a diameter of about 25 nm , microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton .","0"
biology," They help the cell resist compression , provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell , and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell .","0"
biology," 192 . Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate - containing protein molecules called proteoglycans .","1"
biology," Collectively , these materials are called the extracellular matrix ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue , but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other .","0"
biology," 195 . Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes , which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ( [ link ] ) .","1"

biology," A molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged , or non - polar , area is referred to as amphiphilic or “ dual - loving . ”","1"
biology," 204 . Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell , and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving .","0"
biology," In other words , plasma membranes are selectively permeable — they allow some substances to pass through , but not others .","1"
biology," If they were to lose this selectivity , the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself , and it would be destroyed .","0"
biology," 207 . Diffusion is a passive process of transport .","1"
biology," A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space .","0"
biology," 210 . The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins , and they function as either channels for the material or carriers .","1"
biology," In both cases , they are transmembrane proteins .","0"
biology," 213 . Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein .","0"
biology," This aptly named protein binds a substance and , in doing so , triggers a change of its own shape , moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior ( [ link ] ) ; depending on the gradient , the material may move in the opposite direction .","0"
biology," 216 . Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis .","1"
biology," A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .","0"
biology," 219 . As for a hypertonic solution , the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell ’s cytoplasm ; therefore , the fluid contains less water than the cell does .","1"
biology," Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water , water will leave the cell .","0"
biology," 222 . Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell ’s energy , usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .","1"
biology," If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient — that is , if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid ( and vice versa ) — the cell must use energy to move the substance .","0"
biology," 225 . Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small - molecular weight material and small molecules .","0"
biology," Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .","1"
biology," Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .","0"
biology," 228 . An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement : there are three types of these proteins or transporters ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .","1"
biology," A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .","1"
biology," 231 . This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process .","0"
biology," The sodium - potassium pump is , therefore , an electrogenic pump ( a pump that creates a charge imbalance ) , creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential .","1"
biology," 234 . A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis .","0"
biology," This literally means “ cell drinking ” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid .","0"
biology," 237 . In receptor - mediated endocytosis , as in phagocytosis , clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane .","0"
biology," If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor - mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective , the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood .","0"
biology," 240 . Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used , cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy - requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place .","0"
biology," All of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells , including those that use energy and those that release energy , are the cell ’s metabolism .","1"
biology," 243 . Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter .","1"
biology," The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system , and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings .","0"
biology," 246 . However , a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work .","0"
biology," Energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy .","1"
biology," A speeding bullet , a walking person , the rapid movement of molecules in the air ( which produces heat ) , and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy .","0"
biology," 249 . How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction ?","0"
biology," A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers .","0"
biology," Free energy is called Gibbs free energy ( abbreviated with the letter G ) after Josiah Willard Gibbs , the scientist who developed the measurement .","0"
biology," 252 . Thus , the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy - storing molecules .","0"
biology," These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions , and they are non - spontaneous .","1"
biology," An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy .","0"
biology," 255 . The source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings .","0"
biology," Heat energy ( the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction ) speeds up the motion of molecules , increasing the frequency and force with which they collide ; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly , helping them reach their transition state .","1"
biology," For this reason , heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently .","0"
biology," 258 . The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme ’s substrates .","1"
biology," There may be one or more substrates , depending on the particular chemical reaction .","0"
biology," 261 . This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step .","0"
biology," However , current research supports a more refined view called induced fit ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The induced - fit model expands upon the lock - and - key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate .","1"
biology," 264 . Many enzymes do n’t work optimally , or even at all , unless bound to other specific non - protein helper molecules , either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds .","0"
biology," Two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes .","0"
biology," Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes .","0"
biology," 267 . This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable .","0"
biology," The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP , a process called dephosphorylation , releases energy .","1"
biology," 270 . Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism , however , is derived from a much more complex process , chemiosmosis , which takes place in mitochondria ( [ link ] ) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell .","0"
biology," Chemiosmosis , a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight .","1"
biology," The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process .","0"
biology," 273 . Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism .","0"
biology," The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic .","1"
biology," Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells .","0"
biology," 276 . If the cell can not catabolize the pyruvate molecules further , it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose .","0"
biology," Mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respiration — the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen — and glycolysis is their sole source of ATP .","1"
biology," If glycolysis is interrupted , these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium - potassium pumps , and eventually , they die .","0"
biology," 279 . As the protein passes along the Golgi ’s cisternae , it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates .","0"
biology," After its synthesis is complete , it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the Golgi ’s trans face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane .","0"

biology," 282 . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( SER ) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates , lipids , and steroid hormones ; detoxification of medications and poisons ; and storage of calcium ions .","0"
biology," 285 . Complex II directly receives FADH2 , which does not pass through complex I .","0"
biology," The compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone ( Q ) .","1"
biology," The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane .","0"
biology," 288 . In contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor .","0"
biology," Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen .","0"
biology," 291 . Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .","1"
biology," A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as chemoautotrophs .","1"
biology," 294 . The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf , which helps to minimize water loss .","0"
biology," Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes .","0"
biology," In all autotrophic eukaryotes , photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast .","0"
biology," For plants , chloroplast - containing cells exist in the mesophyll .","0"
biology," 297 . Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .","1"
biology," The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .","0"
biology," As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis ) .","1"
biology," Art Connection","0"
biology," 300 . In the light - dependent reactions , energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy .","0"
biology," In the light - independent reactions , the chemical energy harvested during the light - dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide .","0"
biology," Therefore , although the light - independent reactions do not use light as a reactant , they require the products of the light - dependent reactions to function .","0"
biology," 303 . There are five major chlorophylls : a , b , c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll .","0"
biology," Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion .","0"
biology," With dozens of different forms , carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments .","0"
biology," The carotenoids found in fruit — such as the red of tomato ( lycopene ) , the yellow of corn seeds ( zeaxanthin ) , or the orange of an orange peel ( β - carotene ) — are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers .","0"
biology," 306 . When studying a photosynthetic organism , scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra .","0"
biology," An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb .","1"
biology," Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption .","0"
biology," 312 . It is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron .","0"
biology," All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long - term storage in the form of a carbohydrate . PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain , which also includes the cytochrome complex .","0"
biology," The cytochrome complex , an enzyme composed of two protein complexes , transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone ( Pq ) to the protein plastocyanin ( Pc ) , thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI .","1"
biology," 315 . These reactions actually have several names associated with them .","0"
biology," Another term , the Calvin cycle , is named for the man who discovered it , and because these reactions function as a cycle .","0"
biology," Others call it the Calvin - Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery .","0"
biology," 318 . There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells .","0"
biology," Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .","1"
biology," An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous ) .","0"
biology," Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands .","0"
biology," 321 . Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules .","0"
biology," Ligands interact with proteins in target cells , which are cells that are affected by chemical signals ; these proteins are also called receptors .","1"
biology," Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties ; however , a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand .","0"
biology," 324 . Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast - moving electrical impulses .","0"
biology," When these impulses reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell ( the cell emitting the signal ) .","1"
biology," The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells , which are called chemical synapses ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 327 . Autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released .","1"
biology," This means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell ( the prefix auto- means self , a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself ) .","0"
biology," 330 . Cell - surface receptors , also known as transmembrane receptors , are cell surface , membrane - anchored ( integral ) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules .","1"
biology," This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction , in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal .","1"
biology," 333 . G - protein - linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G - protein .","1"
biology," The activated G - protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 336 . Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins .","0"
biology," In some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .","1"
biology," A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .","1"
biology," 339 . This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types .","0"
biology," Another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways , in which signals from two or more different cell - surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell .","1"
biology," This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response .","0"
biology," 342 . The response to the increase in Ca2 + varies , depending on the cell type involved .","0"
biology," For example , in the β - cells of the pancreas , Ca2 + signaling leads to the release of insulin , and in muscle cells , an increase in Ca2 + leads to muscle contractions . Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .","1"
biology," Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 345 . The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol triphosphate ( IP3 ) ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers .","0"
biology," 348 . When a cell is damaged , superfluous , or potentially dangerous to an organism , a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death , or apoptosis .","1"
biology," Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell .","0"
biology," 351 . Budding yeasts ( [ link ] ) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells ( cells with one - half the normal number of chromosomes ) combining to form a diploid cell ( a cell with two sets of each chromosome , which is what normal body cells contain ) .","1"
biology," In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate , budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor .","0"
biology," When mating factor binds to cell - surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby , they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP - binding proteins that are similar to G - proteins .","0"
biology," 354 . The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle .","0"
biology," The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell ’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells .","1"
biology," The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated .","0"
biology," 357 . Human body cells have 46 chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have 23 chromosomes each .","0"
biology," A typical body cell , or somatic cell , contains two matched sets of chromosomes , a configuration known as diploid .","1"
biology," The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is designated 2n .","0"
biology," 360 . Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes .","1"
biology," Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location , or locus .","0"
biology," Genes , the functional units of chromosomes , determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins .","1"
biology," 363 . DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase .","0"
biology," After replication , the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids .","0"
biology," When fully compact , the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins .","0"
biology," 369 . Throughout interphase , nuclear DNA remains in a semi - condensed chromatin configuration .","0"
biology," In the S phase , DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules — sister chromatids — that are firmly attached to the centromeric region .","1"
biology," The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase .","0"
biology," 372 . In the G2 phase , the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation .","1"
biology," Some cell organelles are duplicated , and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase .","0"
biology," 375 . During prophase , the “ first phase , ” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles , and the membranous organelles ( such as the Golgi complex or Golgi apparatus , and endoplasmic reticulum ) , fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell .","1"
biology," The nucleolus disappears ( disperses ) .","0"
biology," 378 . Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete .","0"
biology," Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules .","0"
biology," 381 . During telophase , the “ distance phase , ” the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense ( unravel ) , relaxing into a chromatin configuration .","1"
biology," The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell .","0"
biology," 384 . During telophase , these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast ( a vesicular structure ) at the metaphase plate .","0"
biology," There , the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls ; this structure is called a cell plate .","1"
biology," As more vesicles fuse , the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell .","0"
biology," 387 . The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .","1"
biology," Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .","1"
biology," 393 . Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell .","1"
biology," This type of cell division is called binary ( prokaryotic ) fission . Binary Fission","0"
biology," 396 . Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site .","0"
biology," A septum is formed between the nucleoids , extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell .","0"
biology," When the new cell walls are in place , the daughter cells separate .","0"
biology," 399 . Haploid cells , containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome , are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores .","0"
biology," Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell .","1"
biology," All animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm , or gametes .","0"
biology," 405 . The synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .","1"
biology," The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .","1"
biology," In synapsis , the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other .","0"
biology," 408 . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .","1"
biology," These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .","0"
biology," Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid , the double - stranded DNA is cleaved , the cut ends are modified , and a new connection is made between the non - sister chromatids .","0"
biology," 411 . When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another , the ploidy level — the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus — has been reduced from two to one .","1"
biology," For this reason , meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division .","0"
biology," There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis .","0"
biology," 414 . Nearly all animals employ a diploid - dominant life - cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes .","1"
biology," Early in the development of the embryo , specialized diploid cells , called germ cells , are produced within the gonads , such as the testes and ovaries .","1"
biology," Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes .","0"
biology," 417 . Supported by the monastery , he taught physics , botany , and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels .","0"
biology," In 1856 , he began a decade - long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants , ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system ( a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems ) .","1"
biology," In 1865 , Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society .","0"
biology," 420 . Mendel was the first researcher to see it .","0"
biology," Instead of continuous characteristics , Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes ( specifically , violet versus white flowers ) ; this is referred to as discontinuous variation .","1"
biology," Mendel ’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring , nor were they absorbed , but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on .","0"
biology," 423 . Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .","1"
biology," These offspring were called the F1 , or the first filial ( filial = offspring , daughter or son ) , generation .","0"
biology," Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .","0"
biology," 426 . When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa , he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent , male or female , contributed which trait .","0"
biology," This is called a reciprocal cross — a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross .","1"
biology," For the other six characteristics Mendel examined , the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color .","0"
biology," 429 . The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics .","0"
biology," The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone .","1"
biology," 432 . Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics .","0"
biology," The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .","1"
biology," An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .","1"
biology," 435 . Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .","0"
biology," When P1 plants with contrasting traits were cross - fertilized , all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait , meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined .","0"
biology," 438 . Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents , Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote .","1"
biology," Called the test cross , this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders .","0"
biology," In a test cross , the dominant - expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic .","0"
biology," 441 . A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance , in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote .","1"
biology," An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans .","0"
biology," 444 . The sex chromosomes are one pair of non - homologous chromosomes .","0"
biology," Until now , we have only considered inheritance patterns among non - sex chromosomes , or autosomes .","0"
biology," In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes , human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes , whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair .","1"
biology," 447 . Because the gene is essential , these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization , die in utero , or die later in life , depending on what life stage requires this gene .","0"
biology," An inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non - lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal . For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous , only wild - type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed .","1"
biology," The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1 .","0"
biology," 450 . Observing that true - breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio , Mendel proposed the law of segregation .","0"
biology," This law states that paired unit factors ( genes ) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor .","1"
biology," 453 . However , each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes , organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string .","0"
biology," The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage , in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair .","1"
biology," However , because of the process of recombination , or “ crossover , ” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently , or as if they are not linked .","0"
biology," 456 . It is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes , known as synapsis , does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells .","1"
biology," When synapsed , homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination , or more simply , “ crossing over . ”","1"
biology," 459 . Conversely , alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together .","0"
biology," The average number of crossovers between two alleles — that is , their recombination frequency — correlated with their genetic distance from each other , relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome .","1"
biology," Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above , the frequency of recombination could be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05 .","0"
biology," 462 . A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .","1"
biology," To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 465 . Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes , as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes .","0"
biology," They are caused by nondisjunction , which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis .","1"
biology," Misaligned or incomplete synapsis , or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration , can cause nondisjunction .","0"
biology," 468 . An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets ( two for diploid species ) is called polyploid .","1"
biology," For instance , fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote .","0"
biology," 471 . An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere , or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms , making these inversions easily identifiable .","0"
biology," 474 . Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes .","1"
biology," Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose .","1"
biology," 477 . Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds .","0"
biology," Single - strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single - stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix .","0"
biology," DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) .","0"
biology," 480 . One strand , which is complementary to the 3 ' to 5 ' parental DNA strand , is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction .","1"
biology," This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .","0"
biology," The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .","0"
biology," 483 . The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3 ' to 5 ' , and that of the leading strand 5 ' to 3 ' .","0"
biology," A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides .","0"
biology," The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .","1"
biology," 486 . Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," In proofreading , the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one , so a correction can be made .","0"
biology," The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand .","0"
biology," 489 . Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA .","0"
biology," Mutations , variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome , can also occur because of damage to DNA .","1"
biology," Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .","0"
biology," 492 . Mutations may have a wide range of effects .","0"
biology," Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .","1"
biology," Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .","1"
biology," 495 . Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .","1"
biology," Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .","1"
biology," Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base , known as an insertion , or the removal of a base , also known as deletion .","1"
biology," 498 . The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma ( [ link ] ) , which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs , which in turn specify the sequence of proteins .","1"
biology," The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs .","0"
biology," 501 . This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid .","1"
biology," These nucleotide triplets are called codons .","0"
biology," The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 504 . The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid .","1"
biology," In addition , prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids , which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes .","1"
biology," Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .","0"
biology," 507 . The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site , or the initiation site .","1"
biology," Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .","0"
biology," 510 . coli , the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits , two of which are identical .","0"
biology," Four of these subunits , denoted α , α , β , and β ' comprise the polymerase core enzyme .","0"
biology," These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed , and they disassemble once transcription is complete .","0"
biology," 513 . Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes , a few elements are conserved .","0"
biology," At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site , there are two promoter consensus sequences , or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," The -10 consensus sequence , called the -10 region , is TATAAT .","1"
biology," 516 . The mRNA folds back on itself , and the complementary C – G nucleotides bind together .","0"
biology," The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A – T nucleotides .","0"
biology," The complementary U – A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA .","0"
biology," 519 . This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .","0"
biology," Further upstream of the TATA box , eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC - rich boxes ( GGCG ) or octamer boxes ( ATTTGCAT ) .","0"
biology," These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “ active ” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell .","0"
biology," 522 . Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes , all synthesizing protein in the same direction : reading the mRNA from 5 ' to 3 ' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus .","0"
biology," The complete mRNA / poly - ribosome structure is called a polysome .","1"
biology," 525 . When an in - frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation , a non - formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met - tRNAMet . In E. coli mRNA , a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon , called the Shine - Dalgarno sequence ( AGGAGG ) , interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome .","1"
biology," This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template .","0"
biology," 528 . During and after translation , individual amino acids may be chemically modified , signal sequences may be appended , and the new protein “ folds ” into a distinct three - dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions .","0"
biology," A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment .","1"
biology," These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein ’s “ train ticket ” to its ultimate destination .","0"
biology," 531 . Once elongation is complete , the pre - mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU - rich sequence , leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre - mRNA .","0"
biology," An enzyme called poly - A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues , called the poly - A tail .","1"
biology," This modification further protects the pre - mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm .","0"
biology," 534 . Some of a ribosome ’s RNA molecules are purely structural , whereas others have catalytic or binding activities .","0"
biology," Mature tRNAs take on a three - dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," The anticodon is a three - nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary base pairing .","1"
biology," 537 . The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm .","0"
biology," Proteins that are needed for a specific function , or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway , are encoded together in blocks called operons .","1"
biology," For example , all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose ( or lac ) operon .","0"
biology," 540 . coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes .","0"
biology," These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan ( trp ) operon ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," If tryptophan is present in the environment , then E .","0"
biology," 543 . When tryptophan is not present in the cell , the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator ; therefore , the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized .","0"
biology," Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off , the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators .","0"
biology," 546 . The lac Operon : An Inducer OperonThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons , which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell .","1"
biology," The lac operon is a typical inducible operon .","0"
biology," 549 . There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif .","0"
biology," When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .","1"
biology," The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .","1"
biology," 552 . Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it is given two protective "" caps "" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey .","0"
biology," The 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) . The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .","1"
biology," 555 . Proteins , called RNA - binding proteins , or RBPs , can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein - coding region .","0"
biology," These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions , or UTRs .","1"
biology," They are not introns ( those have been removed in the nucleus ) .","0"
biology," 558 . The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre - miRNAs .","0"
biology," These pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .","0"
biology," Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .","0"
biology," 561 . In translation , the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex .","1"
biology," The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .","1"
biology," The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .","0"
biology," 564 . GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .","0"
biology," The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit .","0"
biology," When bound , the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex , bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated .","0"
biology," 567 . While these changes do n’t occur simultaneously in one cancer , changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals .","0"
biology," Therefore , changes in histone acetylation ( epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing ) , activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation , increased RNA stability , increased translational control , and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells .","1"
biology," Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell .","0"
biology," 570 . Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired ( such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample ) .","0"
biology," Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .","1"
biology," Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .","0"
biology," 573 . DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) .","1"
biology," The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand ( called cDNA ) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA .","0"
biology," 576 . The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences .","0"
biology," When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , the technique is called Southern blotting , and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , it is called northern blotting .","1"
biology," Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome , and northern blots are used to detect gene expression .","0"
biology," 579 . Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone .","1"
biology," An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) .","0"
biology," The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .","1"
biology," 582 . They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis .","0"
biology," Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins .","1"
biology," Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes .","0"
biology," 585 . Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism ’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism ’s DNA to achieve desirable traits .","1"
biology," The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .","0"
biology," 588 . The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting .","0"
biology," Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene , either by introducing mutations in a gene , or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism .","1"
biology," 591 . In nature , the disease - causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids , called the Ti plasmids ( tumor - inducing plasmids ) , that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants .","1"
biology," DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell ’s genome .","0"
biology," 594 . The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets .","0"
biology," A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome .","1"
biology," Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .","0"
biology," 597 . The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis , a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment .","1"
biology," The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA .","0"
biology," 600 . There are three methods used to create a physical map : cytogenetic mapping , radiation hybrid mapping , and sequence mapping .","0"
biology," Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .","0"
biology," 603 . Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs .","0"
biology," The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping .","1"
biology," A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology ( a sequence - tagged site , or STS ) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location .","1"
biology," 606 . The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method ( also known as the dideoxy method ) , which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s .","0"
biology," The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single - stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide ( dNTP ) , which is a monomer , or a single unit , of DNA . The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ( ddNTPs ) .","0"
biology," 609 . By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment , the entire DNA sequence can be reformed .","0"
biology," A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig .","1"
biology," As an analogy , consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear .","0"
biology," 612 . A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms .","0"
biology," A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism .","1"
biology," Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms .","0"
biology," 615 . A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type .","1"
biology," Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs , and the mRNAs encode proteins .","0"
biology," 618 . Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .","1"
biology," The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .","1"
biology," Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics , as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors .","0"
biology," 621 . The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false - negative results .","0"
biology," A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive .","1"
biology," In other words , many cases of cancer go undetected , which makes biomarkers unreliable .","0"
biology," 624 . Traditionally , microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions , which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory .","1"
biology," Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours , their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly .","0"
biology," 627 . Natural selection can only take place if there is variation , or differences , among individuals in a population .","0"
biology," Importantly , these differences must have some genetic basis ; otherwise , the selection will not lead to change in the next generation .","0"
biology," 630 . However , the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures .","0"
biology," This phenomenon is called convergent evolution , where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry .","1"
biology," The two species came to the same function , flying , but did so separately from each other . These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs .","0"
biology," 633 . Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with .","0"
biology," An area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce , forming hybrids , is called a hybrid zone .","1"
biology," Over time , the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," 636 . In the gradual speciation model , species diverge gradually over time in small steps .","1"
biology," In the punctuated equilibrium model , a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species , and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," This early change model is called punctuated equilibrium , because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward .","0"
biology," 639 . Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation : the formation of two species from one original species .","1"
biology," Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in On the Origin of Species ( [ link]a ) .","0"
biology," 642 . Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories : dispersal and vicariance .","0"
biology," Dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area , and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms .","1"
biology," 645 . The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid .","1"
biology," The prefix “ allo- ” means “ other ” ( recall from allopatric ) : therefore , an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine .","0"
biology," 648 . Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .","1"
biology," A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .","1"
biology," 651 . Behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place .","1"
biology," For example , male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females .","0"
biology," 654 . Initially , the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur .","0"
biology," But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis — the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today .","1"
biology," In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .","0"
biology," 657 . The allele frequency ( or gene frequency ) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population .","1"
biology," Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms , but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change .","0"
biology," 660 . If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population , p + q = 1 .","0"
biology," In other words , all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population . But what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles , but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes , known as the population ’s genetic structure , from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes .","0"
biology," If the phenotype is observed , only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known ; the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes .","0"
biology," 663 . The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance .","1"
biology," When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .","0"
biology," 666 . Over time , the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population , and the population will , as a result , grow larger on average .","0"
biology," That is , this would occur if this particular selection pressure , or driving selective force , were the only one acting on the population .","0"
biology," In other examples , better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure .","0"
biology," 669 . Another important evolutionary force is gene flow : the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," While some populations are fairly stable , others experience more flux .","0"
biology," 672 . Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations .","0"
biology," Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .","0"
biology," One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .","1"
biology," 675 . An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that , for example , increases the ability to reproduce ( fecundity ) , but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease , that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age .","1"
biology," Natural selection acts at the level of the individual ; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation , known as an organism ’s evolutionary ( Darwinian ) fitness .","1"
biology," 678 . When the environment changes , populations will often undergo directional selection ( [ link ] ) , which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation .","1"
biology," A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth - century England .","0"
biology," 681 . Males are often larger , for example , and display many elaborate colors and adornments , like the peacock ’s tail , while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration .","1"
biology," Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms ( [ link ] ) , which arise from the fact that in many populations , particularly animal populations , there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females .","0"
biology," That is , some males — often the bigger , stronger , or more decorated males — get the vast majority of the total matings , while others receive none .","0"
biology," 684 . In 1915 , biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection : the Fisherian runaway model , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference . In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis , the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males ’ quality , thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates — males that will pass the best genes to their offspring .","1"
biology," 687 . Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor .","0"
biology," Scientists call such trees rooted , which means there is a single ancestral lineage ( typically drawn from the bottom or left ) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate .","0"
biology," Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains — Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya — diverge from a single point and branch off .","0"
biology," 690 . A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .","1"
biology," When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .","1"
biology," A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .","1"
biology," 693 . Taxonomy ( which literally means “ arrangement law ” ) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings .","1"
biology," Think about how a grocery store is organized .","0"
biology," 699 . With the advancement of DNA technology , the area of molecular systematics , which describes the use of information on the molecular level including DNA analysis , has blossomed .","1"
biology," New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms , but also uncover previously made errors .","0"
biology," 702 . If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group , it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait .","1"
biology," The vertebrate in [ link ] is a shared ancestral character .","0"
biology," 705 . Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parent(s ) to offspring .","1"
biology," These transfers allow even distantly related species to share genes , influencing their phenotypes .","0"
biology," 708 . The nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link ] a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .","1"
biology," The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .","1"
biology," 711 . As shown in [ link ] a , some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes , whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts .","1"
biology," This model is often called the “ web of life . ” In an effort to save the tree analogy , some have proposed using the Ficus tree ( [ link]b ) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.In the ( a ) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle , the “ tree of life ” arose from a community of ancestral cells , has multiple trunks , and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred .","1"
biology," Visually , this concept is better represented by ( b ) the multi - trunked Ficus than by the single trunk of the oak similar to the tree drawn by Darwin [ link ] .","0"
biology," 717 . All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins , called a capsid .","1"
biology," The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres .","0"
biology," Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “ spheres , ” whereas others are quite complex in structure . In general , the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups : filamentous , isometric ( or icosahedral ) , enveloped , and head and tail .","0"
biology," 720 . Unlike nearly all living organisms that use DNA as their genetic material , viruses may use either DNA or RNA as theirs .","0"
biology," The virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus .","0"
biology," Viral genomes tend to be small , containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus can not get from the host cell .","0"
biology," 723 . They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .","0"
biology," Group III viruses use dsRNA as their genome .","0"
biology," The strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .","0"
biology," 729 . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .","0"
biology," Group VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA , but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase , necessary for genome replication .","0"
biology," The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in [ link ] with examples of each group .","0"
biology," 732 . These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .","1"
biology," Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .","1"
biology," The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .","0"
biology," 735 . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .","0"
biology," 738 . Sometimes , however , a virus can remain within the cell without being released .","0"
biology," For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .","0"
biology," When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .","1"
biology," 741 . The viral genome is then “ injected ” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages .","0"
biology," Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors : receptor - mediated endocytosis , or fusion .","0"
biology," Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor - mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non - enveloped viruses .","0"
biology," 744 . Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .","0"
biology," Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .","1"
biology," 747 . When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .","1"
biology," Other viruses induce hypoplasia , or decreased cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear .","0"
biology," 750 . While we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs , such as those used to treat HIV and influenza , the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination , which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus family ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Vaccines may be prepared using live viruses , killed viruses , or molecular subunits of the virus .","0"
biology," The killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease .","0"
biology," 753 . The study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non - viral diseases .","0"
biology," Viruses have been used in gene therapy .","0"
biology," Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) , a heritable , recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems .","1"
biology," 756 . Prions and viroids are pathogens ( agents with the ability to cause disease ) that have simpler structures than viruses but , in the case of prions , still can produce deadly diseases .","1"
biology," 759 . ViroidsViroids are plant pathogens : small , single - stranded , circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus .","1"
biology," They do not have a capsid or outer envelope , but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell .","0"
biology," 762 . The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents .","0"
biology," A hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth ’s surface that releases geothermally heated water .","1"
biology," With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago , some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source — sunlight — whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food .","0"
biology," 765 . Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth ’s existence , the atmosphere was anoxic , meaning that there was no molecular oxygen .","1"
biology," Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .","1"
biology," Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .","1"
biology," 768 . Other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles , meaning “ lovers of extremes . ” Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments : the depth of the oceans , hot springs , the Artic and the Antarctic , in very dry places , deep inside Earth , in harsh chemical environments , and in high radiation environments ( [ link ] ) , just to mention a few .","1"
biology," These organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications .","0"
biology," 771 . The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood .","0"
biology," In a process called resuscitation , the prokaryote can go back to “ normal ” life when environmental conditions improve .","0"
biology," 774 . For example , the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces , protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells , and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses .","0"
biology," Some species also have flagella ( singular , flagellum ) used for locomotion , and pili ( singular , pilus ) used for attachment to surfaces .","0"
biology," Plasmids , which consist of extra - chromosomal DNA , are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea .","0"
biology," 777 . Bacteria are divided into two major groups : Gram positive and Gram negative , based on their reaction to Gram staining .","0"
biology," Note that all Gram - positive bacteria belong to one phylum ; bacteria in the other phyla ( Proteobacteria , Chlamydias , Spirochetes , Cyanobacteria , and others ) are Gram - negative .","1"
biology," 780 . In transformation , the prokaryote takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes .","1"
biology," If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome , it too may become pathogenic .","0"
biology," 783 . Recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers .","0"
biology," For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life , they need certain substances , collectively called nutrients .","0"
biology," When prokaryotes grow in nature , they obtain their nutrients from the environment .","0"
biology," 786 . Consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .","0"
biology," Then , bacteria and fungi , collectively called decomposers , carry out the breakdown ( decomposition ) of plants and animals and their organic compounds .","1"
biology," The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material ( dead animals , plants , and humus ) that undergo respiration .","0"
biology," 789 . Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes , yielding N2 as the final product .","0"
biology," Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate .","1"
biology," Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas , Nitrobacter , and Nitrospira .","0"
biology," 792 . An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .","1"
biology," A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .","1"
biology," An endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present , usually at low incidence , in a population .","1"
biology," 795 . Therefore , changes in the environment , the pathogen , or the host population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease .","0"
biology," According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) an emerging disease ( [ link ] ) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time , or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range .","1"
biology," This definition also includes re - emerging diseases that were previously under control .","0"
biology," 798 . For example , Staphylococcus aureus , often called “ staph , ” is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics .","1"
biology," A very dangerous strain , however , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) has made the news over the past few years ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," This strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics , including methicillin , amoxicillin , penicillin , and oxacillin .","0"
biology," 801 . Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness . ”The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .","0"
biology," In the past , it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of botulism , the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum .","1"
biology," Some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non - acidic canned foods , homemade pickles , and processed meat and sausages .","0"
biology," 804 . Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free - living organisms by a factor of 10 .","0"
biology," Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules , specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Nitrogenase , the enzyme that fixes nitrogen , is inactivated by oxygen , so the nodule provides an oxygen - free area for nitrogen fixation to take place .","1"
biology," 807 . In order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully , it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s ) of an alpha - proteobacterium that “ took up residence ” inside it .","0"
biology," This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis , one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit .","1"
biology," Over many generations , a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own .","0"
biology," 810 . Protist cells may be enveloped by animal - like cell membranes or plant - like cell walls .","0"
biology," Others are encased in glassy silica - based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips .","0"
biology," The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor , preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion .","1"
biology," 813 . Until recently , these protists were believed to lack mitochondria .","0"
biology," Mitochondrial remnant organelles , called mitosomes , have since been identified in diplomonads , but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional .","1"
biology," Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways , such as glycolysis , to generate energy .","1"
biology," 816 . Together , the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates .","0"
biology," These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats , and are a component of plankton , the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms .","1"
biology," 819 . Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually , although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist .","0"
biology," Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell , called a raphe .","0"
biology," By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe , the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction .","0"
biology," 822 . Foraminiferans , or forams , are unicellular heterotrophic protists , ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to several centimeters in length , and occasionally resembling tiny snails ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," As a group , the forams exhibit porous shells , called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate .","1"
biology," The tests may house photosynthetic algae , which the forams can harvest for nutrition .","0"
biology," 825 . In addition , their mode of nutrition was poorly understood .","0"
biology," Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology : the scientific study of fungi .","1"
biology," Based on fossil evidence , fungi appeared in the pre - Cambrian era , about 450 million years ago .","0"
biology," 828 . They display two distinct morphological stages : the vegetative and reproductive .","0"
biology," The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread - like structures called hyphae ( singular , hypha ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous .","1"
biology," The mass of hyphae is a mycelium ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 831 . The hyphae in bread molds ( which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota ) are not separated by septa .","0"
biology," Instead , they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei , an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae ( [ link]b ) .","0"
biology," 834 . Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .","1"
biology," Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .","0"
biology," This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration , but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available .","1"
biology," 837 . Spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments .","0"
biology," They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium .","0"
biology," 840 . Although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction , all include the following three stages ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," First , during plasmogamy ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , two haploid cells fuse , leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell .","1"
biology," During karyogamy ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus .","1"
biology," 843 . The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota .","1"
biology," They include the familiar bread mold , Rhizopus stolonifer , which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads , fruits , and vegetables .","0"
biology," 846 . In each ascus , two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy .","0"
biology," During sexual reproduction , thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp .","1"
biology," The diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis .","0"
biology," 849 . Asexual Ascomycota and BasidiomycotaImperfect fungi — those that do not display a sexual phase — use to be classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota , , a classification group no longer used in the present , ever - developing classification of organisms .","0"
biology," While Deuteromycota use to be a classification group , recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the Ascomycota or the Basidiomycota classifications .","0"
biology," 852 . Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .","0"
biology," It appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae : the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus , and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant . The glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots .","1"
biology," Although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes , they do not form zygospores .","0"
biology," 855 . Fungi can affect animals , including humans , in several ways .","0"
biology," A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage .","1"
biology," Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues .","0"
biology," 858 . One of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae .","0"
biology," Mycorrhiza , which comes from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root , refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi .","1"
biology," Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners .","0"
biology," 861 . Lichens display a range of colors and textures ( [ link ] ) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats .","1"
biology," They cover rocks , gravestones , tree bark , and the ground in the tundra where plant roots can not penetrate .","0"
biology," 864 . In both seedless and seed plants , the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte .","1"
biology," This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes .","0"
biology," 867 . After germinating from a spore , the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia , usually on the same individual .","0"
biology," In contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores .","1"
biology," The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .","1"
biology," 870 . The spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin .","1"
biology," This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids : hence the yellow color of most pollen .","0"
biology," 873 . The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .","0"
biology," Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .","0"
biology," The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte .","1"
biology," 876 . Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts , and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes .","1"
biology," Consequently , land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta .","1"
biology," 879 . The hornworts ( Anthocerotophyta ) belong to the broad bryophyte group .","0"
biology," They have colonized a variety of habitats on land , although they are never far from a source of moisture .","0"
biology," 882 . The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in [ link ] .","0"
biology," The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema — usually , a tangle of single - celled filaments that hug the ground .","1"
biology," Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore , consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage - like structures .","0"
biology," 885 . The vascular plants , or tracheophytes , are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants .","1"
biology," More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth ’s vegetation .","0"
biology," 888 . Phloem is the second type of vascular tissue ; it transports sugars , proteins , and other solutes throughout the plant .","1"
biology," Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements ( conducting cells ) and cells that support the sieve elements .","0"
biology," 891 . Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches , or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities .","0"
biology," Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins .","1"
biology," Megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution .","0"
biology," 894 . The club mosses , or phylum Lycopodiophyta , are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants .","1"
biology," They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous , growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests .","0"
biology," 897 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Ferns)With their large fronds , ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants .","0"
biology," They are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants .","1"
biology," 900 . Gymnosperms , meaning “ naked seeds , ” are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic .","1"
biology," Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all members are descendants of a single common ancestor .","1"
biology," 903 . The male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili .","0"
biology," Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant , described as monoecious ( “ one home ” or bisexual ) , or on separate plants , referred to as dioecious ( “ two homes ” or unisexual ) plants .","1"
biology," The life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms .","0"
biology," 906 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale .","0"
biology," One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule .","0"
biology," Three of the four cells break down ; only a single surviving cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte , which encloses archegonia ( an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg ) .","1"
biology," 909 . The single surviving species of the gingkophytes group is the Gingko biloba ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Its fan - shaped leaves — unique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation pattern — turn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree .","1"
biology," 912 . For example , the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical .","0"
biology," Petals , collectively the corolla , are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators .","1"
biology," Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small , feathery , and visually inconspicuous .","0"
biology," 915 . Flower structure is very diverse , and carpels may be singular , multiple , or fused .","0"
biology," Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil .","1"
biology," The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel .","0"
biology," 918 . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .","1"
biology," Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .","1"
biology," The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .","0"
biology," 924 . Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem ; in monocots , vascular tissue is scattered in the stem .","0"
biology," Eudicots can be herbaceous ( like grasses ) , or produce woody tissues .","0"
biology," Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate , with three furrows or pores .","1"
biology," 927 . It is possible , for example , to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flower ’s characteristics .","0"
biology," Many bird or insect - pollinated flowers secrete nectar , which is a sugary liquid .","1"
biology," They also produce both fertile pollen , for reproduction , and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects .","0"
biology," 930 . Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .","0"
biology," Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .","1"
biology," 936 . Male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell gamete though a pollen tube : an extension of a cell within the pollen grain .","1"
biology," The sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella , but in cycads and the Gingko , the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete ; however , they are enclosed in a pollen grain .","0"
biology," 939 . Most animals reproduce sexually , and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan .","0"
biology," The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal , determined by developmental cues .","1"
biology," All animals are heterotrophs that derive energy from food .","0"
biology," The ( a ) black bear is an omnivore , eating both plants and animals .","0"
biology," 942 . Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .","1"
biology," This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage , the gastrula , in which the future digestive cavity is formed .","1"
biology," Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .","0"
biology," 945 . These genes that determine animal structure are called “ homeotic genes , ” and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes .","1"
biology," The animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as Hox genes .","1"
biology," This family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan , such as the number of body segments of an animal , the number and placement of appendages , and animal head - tail directionality .","0"
biology," 948 . The animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers , an inner layer ( endoderm ) and an outer layer ( ectoderm ) .","1"
biology," These animals are called diploblasts .","0"
biology," Diploblasts have a non - living layer between the endoderm and ectoderm .","0"
biology," 954 . Bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development .","0"
biology," Protostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .","0"
biology," Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .","0"
biology," 957 . Recent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes , however , and the theory remains under debate . Another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation , beginning from the gastrula stage .","0"
biology," The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely , meaning that during development , a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom .","1"
biology," Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely .","0"
biology," 960 . This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .","0"
biology," Deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage , where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis , resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles .","0"
biology," 966 . The time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran period ( from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago ) , the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," It is believed that early animal life , termed Ediacaran biota , evolved from protists at this time .","1"
biology," 969 . On the other hand , cataclysmic events , such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life , can result in devastating losses of diversity .","0"
biology," Such periods of mass extinction ( [ link ] ) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life , erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind .","0"
biology," The end of the Permian period ( and the Paleozoic Era ) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth ’s history , a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time .","0"
biology," 972 . Morphology of Sponges","0"
biology," The morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity , the spongocoel , occupying the inside of the cylinder .","1"
biology," Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .","0"
biology," 978 . The second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes ( or archaeocytes ) , named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba - like fashion .","1"
biology," Amoebocytes have a variety of functions : delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge , giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction ( which remain in the mesohyl ) , delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs , and differentiating into more - specific cell types .","0"
biology," 981 . Phylum Cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic , that is , they develop from two embryonic layers . Nearly all ( about 99 percent ) cnidarians are marine species .","1"
biology," 984 . Click here to follow the life cycle of the Obelia .","0"
biology," All cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo .","1"
biology," The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .","0"
biology," Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .","0"
biology," 987 . The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .","0"
biology," The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .","1"
biology," Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment , and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity .","0"
biology," 990 . This is called protostomy or “ first mouth . ”","0"
biology," In protostomy , solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells .","1"
biology," This layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom ; this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom .","1"
biology," 993 . The Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms .","1"
biology," Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine , predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers , with an estimated 900 species known .","0"
biology," However , nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well .","0"
biology," 996 . The zygote then develops into a planuliform larva .","0"
biology," In some nemertine species , a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm , from a series of imaginal discs .","0"
biology," This larval form , characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap , devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult - like morphology .","1"
biology," 999 . Additionally , a tongue - like organ called a radula , which bears chitinous tooth - like ornamentation , is present in many species , and serves to shred or scrape food .","1"

biology," 1005 . Phylum Annelida includes segmented worms .","0"
biology," These animals are found in marine , terrestrial , and freshwater habitats , but a presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival , especially in terrestrial habitats .","0"
biology," 1008 . Circular as well as longitudinal muscles are located interior to the epidermis .","0"
biology," Chitinous hairlike extensions , anchored in the epidermis and projecting from the cuticle , called setae / chaetae are present in every segment .","1"
biology," Annelids show the presence of a true coelom , derived from embryonic mesoderm and protostomy .","0"
biology," 1011 . The name “ arthropoda ” means “ jointed legs ” ( in the Greek , “ arthros ” means “ joint ” and “ podos ” means “ leg ” ) ; it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum .","1"
biology," Arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated 85 percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented .","0"
biology," The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages .","0"
biology," 1014 . Unlike that of the Hexapoda , the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax ( [ link ] ) , which is covered by a plate called the carapace , thus producing a body structure of two tagma .","0"
biology," Crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size .","0"
biology," 1017 . Larval stages — nauplius and zoea — are seen in the early development of crustaceans .","0"
biology," A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ( [ link ] ) .","0"

biology," In some species , like sea spiders , an additional pair of appendages , called ovigers , is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps .","1"
biology," 1023 . Phylum EchinodermataEchinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin ( from the Greek “ echinos ” meaning “ spiny ” and “ dermos ” meaning “ skin ” ) , and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species .","1"
biology," Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms .","0"
biology," Sea stars ( [ link ] ) , sea cucumbers , sea urchins , sand dollars , and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms .","0"
biology," 1026 . Phylum ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail .","0"
biology," In some groups , some of these traits are present only during embryonic development .","0"
biology," 1029 . The dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development .","0"
biology," In chordates , it is located dorsal to the notochord .","0"
biology," 1032 . The post - anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body , extending beyond the anus .","1"
biology," The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles , which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species , such as fishes .","0"
biology," 1035 . Extant members of Cephalochordata are the lancelets , named for their blade - like shape .","1"
biology," Lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas .","0"
biology," 1038 . Vertebrates are members of the clade Vertebrata .","0"
biology," Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates .","0"
biology," 1041 . The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes .","0"
biology," Hagfishes are eel - like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," 1044 . The clade Petromyzontidae includes approximately 35 – 40 or more species of lampreys .","0"
biology," Lampreys are similar to hagfishes in size and shape ; however , lampreys possess some vertebral elements .","1"
biology," Lampreys lack paired appendages and bone , as do the hagfishes .","0"

biology," Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa .","0"

biology," Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli .","0"
biology," 1692 . Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases .","1"
biology," The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture .","0"
biology," 1695 . On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .","0"
biology," The expiratory reserve volume ( ERV ) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .","1"
biology," It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .","0"
biology," 1698 . Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes .","0"
biology," The vital capacity ( VC ) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle .","1"
biology," It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .","0"
biology," 1701 . The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .","1"
biology," Lastly , the total lung capacity ( TLC ) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold .","1"
biology," It is the sum of the residual volume , expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .","0"
biology," 1704 . In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .","1"
biology," The ratio of these values ( FEV1 / FVC ratio ) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma , emphysema , and fibrosis .","0"
biology," If the FEV1 / FVC ratio is high , the lungs are not compliant ( meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly ) , and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis .","0"
biology," 1707 . The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs .","0"
biology," The lungs are elastic ; therefore , when air fills the lungs , the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs .","0"
biology," These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath .","0"
biology," 1710 . The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .","1"
biology," Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .","1"
biology," 1713 . There are two types of work conducted during respiration , flow - resistive and elastic work .","0"
biology," Flow - resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung , whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles , chest wall , and diaphragm .","1"
biology," Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow - resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles .","0"
biology," 1716 . Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs .","0"
biology," Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance ( how elastic the lung is ) and resistance ( how much obstruction exists in the airways ) .","1"
biology," A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide .","0"
biology," 1719 . Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema , asthma , and pulmonary edema .","0"
biology," In emphysema , which mostly arises from smoking tobacco , the walls of the alveoli are destroyed , decreasing the surface area for gas exchange .","1"
biology," 1722 . There are two types of V / Q mismatch .","0"
biology," Both produce dead space , regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue .","1"
biology," Dead spaces can severely impact breathing , because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion .","0"
biology," 1725 . HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .","0"
biology," Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red .","0"
biology," 1728 . Increased temperature , such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle , causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced . Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood ’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen - carrying capacity .","0"
biology," In sickle cell anemia , the shape of the red blood cell is crescent - shaped , elongated , and stiffened , reducing its ability to deliver oxygen ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," In this form , red blood cells can not pass through the capillaries .","0"
biology," 1731 . Third , the majority of carbon dioxide molecules ( 85 percent ) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system .","0"
biology," In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .","1"
biology," 1734 . In all vertebrate organisms , as well as some invertebrates , this is a closed - loop system , in which the blood is not free in a cavity .","0"
biology," In a closed circulatory system , blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route , then returns to the heart again , as illustrated in [ link ] a .","1"
biology," As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link ] b .","0"
biology," 1737 . As illustrated in [ link ] a","0"
biology," Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two - chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle .","0"
biology," The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .","1"
biology," The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .","0"
biology," 1740 . The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .","1"
biology," In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .","0"
biology," 1743 . The blood is more than the proteins , though .","0"
biology," Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma ( the liquid portion , which contains water , proteins , salts , lipids , and glucose ) and the cells ( red and white cells ) and cell fragments called platelets .","1"
biology," Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water , proteins , electrolytes , lipids , and glucose .","0"
biology," 1746 . The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum .","1"
biology," Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves .","0"
biology," 1749 . The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .","1"
biology," After it is filled , the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries , by - passing the semilunar valve ( or pulmonic valve ) to the lungs for re - oxygenation .","0"
biology," After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries , the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle .","0"
biology," 1752 . The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .","0"
biology," The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .","1"
biology," The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .","1"
biology," 1755 . The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .","1"
biology," They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .","0"
biology," The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .","0"
biology," 1758 . The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body ; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle .","0"
biology," The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax .","1"
biology," The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .","0"
biology," 1761 . The electrical signals and mechanical actions , illustrated in [ link ] , are intimately intertwined .","0"
biology," The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial ( SA ) node , which is located near the wall of the right atrium .","0"
biology," Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison .","0"
biology," 1764 . The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs .","1"
biology," The major arteries diverge into minor arteries , and then smaller vessels called arterioles , to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body .","0"
biology," 1767 . The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .","0"
biology," Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .","1"
biology," The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply .","0"
biology," 1770 . The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava .","0"
biology," Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells .","1"
biology," The white blood cells remove infectious agents , such as bacteria and viruses , to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream .","0"
biology," 1773 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .","1"
biology," Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .","1"
biology," 1776 . An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .","1"
biology," A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .","0"
biology," Both electrolytes and non - electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance .","0"
biology," 1779 . Thus , one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams .","0"
biology," The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .","1"
biology," The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .","1"
biology," 1782 . When they move to a hypertonic marine environment , these fish start drinking sea water ; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine , as illustrated in [ link]b .","0"
biology," Most marine invertebrates , on the other hand , may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers ) .","0"
biology," Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration .","0"
biology," 1785 . Externally , the kidneys are surrounded by three layers , illustrated in [ link ] .","0"
biology," The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .","1"
biology," The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .","1"
biology," 1788 . The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .","0"
biology," Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .","0"
biology," The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .","1"
biology," 1791 . The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .","0"
biology," In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .","0"
biology," The tips of the pyramids , called renal papillae , point toward the renal pelvis .","0"
biology," 1794 . The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .","0"
biology," On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .","0"
biology," The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .","1"
biology," 1797 . Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .","0"
biology," The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .","0"
biology," Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .","0"
biology," 1800 . The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .","0"
biology," Cortical radiate arteries , as the name suggests , radiate out from the arcuate arteries .","0"
biology," The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles , and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons .","1"
biology," 1803 . The renal corpuscle , located in the renal cortex , is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule , a cup - shaped chamber that surrounds it , called the glomerular or Bowman 's capsule .","1"
biology," 1806 . The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .","1"
biology," The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex .","0"
biology," The DCT , which is the last part of the nephron , connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids .","1"
biology," 1809 . Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed .","1"
biology," Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus , it forms the peritubular capillary network , which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule .","0"
biology," In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .","0"
biology," 1812 . Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules .","0"
biology," Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption .","1"
biology," In the loop of Henle , the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network .","0"
biology," 1815 . This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries .","0"
biology," However , every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed . In the loop of Henle , the permeability of the membrane changes .","0"
biology," The descending limb is permeable to water , not solutes ; the opposite is true for the ascending limb .","0"
biology," 1818 . This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types .","0"
biology," For example , the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa , which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells .","0"
biology," Together , the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex ( JGC ) .","1"
biology," 1821 . They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia .","0"
biology," Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore .","0"
biology," They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion .","0"
biology," 1824 . Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body .","0"
biology," Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia , which raises the pH of body fluids .","0"
biology," The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system .","0"
biology," 1830 . GoutMammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells .","0"
biology," However , too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout , where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints , as illustrated in [ link ] .","1"
biology," 1833 . The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses .","0"
biology," Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology ; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response .","1"
biology," Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins , receptor - mediated signaling , and intricate cell - to - cell communication .","0"
biology," 1836 . A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens .","1"
biology," Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) .","0"
biology," PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment .","1"
biology," 1839 . A second class of early - acting cytokines is interferons , which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells .","1"
biology," One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication .","0"
biology," They also have other important functions , such as tumor surveillance .","0"
biology," 1842 . Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes , and they contain organelles , called lysosomes , that digest engulfed pathogens .","1"
biology," An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite ; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes ( parasitic worms ) .","1"
biology," 1845 . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .","1"
biology," Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .","1"
biology," 1848 . T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .","1"
biology," NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .","0"
biology," MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non - nucleated .","1"
biology," 1851 . Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse .","0"
biology," A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death , or apoptosis .","1"
biology," Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind .","0"
biology," 1854 . The adaptive , or acquired , immune response takes days or even weeks to become established — much longer than the innate response ; however , adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory .","0"
biology," Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination .","1"
biology," This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection .","0"
biology," 1857 . The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens , and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens .","1"
biology," An antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) is an immune cell that detects , engulfs , and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection .","1"
biology," When a pathogen is detected , these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen .","0"
biology," 1860 . These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC .","0"
biology," Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .","1"
biology," In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .","1"
biology," 1863 . When a TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen , it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( clonal ) copies of it , and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs .","0"
biology," The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection .","1"
biology," This phenomenon drastically , but briefly , changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system , and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen .","0"
biology," 1866 . The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful , unnecessary responses to harmless substances , and more importantly so that it does not attack “ self . ”","0"
biology," The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance .","1"
biology," Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .","0"
biology," 1869 . A memory cell is an antigen - specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response , but that can immediately become effector cells upon re - exposure to the same pathogen .","1"
biology," During the primary immune response , memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses .","0"
biology," 1872 . For instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor ’s blood serum .","1"
biology," This phenomenon is called passive immunity ; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding , which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life .","0"
biology," 1875 . Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region ( the surface area of about four to six amino acids ) , it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions .","0"
biology," Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion , but to a different antigen .","1"
biology," 1878 . Thus , the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly .","0"
biology," Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .","1"
biology," 1881 . As previously discussed , antidiuretic hormone or ADH ( also called vasopressin ) , as the name suggests , helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume , especially that of blood , is low .","1"
biology," It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary .","0"
biology," 1884 . Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities .","1"
biology," The types of hypersensitivities include immediate , delayed , and autoimmunity .","0"
biology," 1887 . Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .","0"
biology," Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies .","1"
biology," In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis , muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies .","0"
biology," 1890 . Fission , also called binary fission , occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate , multi - celled organisms .","0"
biology," After a period of growth , an organism splits into two separate organisms .","1"
biology," 1893 . Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized .","1"
biology," The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid , depending on the process and the species .","0"
biology," 1896 . There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization .","0"
biology," In oviparity , fertilized eggs are laid outside the female ’s body and develop there , receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg .","1"
biology," This occurs in most bony fish , many reptiles , some cartilaginous fish , most amphibians , two mammals , and all birds .","0"
biology," 1899 . When they are released from the ovary , they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization .","0"
biology," Some insects have a specialized sac , called a spermatheca , which stores sperm for later use , sometimes up to a year .","1"
biology," Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival .","0"
biology," 1902 . In the male reproductive system , the scrotum houses the testicles or testes ( singular : testis ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , nerves , and muscles related to testicular function .","0"
biology," The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones .","1"
biology," Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm ( 1.5 by 1 in ) in size and divided into wedge - shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa .","0"
biology," 1905 . These are the seminal vesicles , the prostate gland , and the bulbourethral gland , all of which are illustrated in [ link ] .","0"
biology," The seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder .","1"
biology," The glands make a solution that is thick , yellowish , and alkaline .","0"
biology," 1908 . The bulbourethral gland , or Cowper ’s gland , releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen .","1"
biology," It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine .","0"
biology," 1911 . The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .","0"
biology," The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora .","1"
biology," These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra .","0"
biology," 1914 . The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes .","1"
biology," It allows menstrual flow to leave the body .","0"
biology," 1917 . When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .","0"
biology," This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .","0"
biology," Note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced .","0"
biology," 1920 . Testosterone , the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence , stimulates spermatogenesis .","1"
biology," These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice , the growth of facial , axillary , and pubic hair , and the beginnings of the sex drive .","0"
biology," 1923 . These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .","0"
biology," Progesterone assists in endometrial re - growth and inhibition of FSH and LH release .","1"
biology," 1929 . To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg , once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane , the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg .","0"
biology," If this mechanism fails , multiple sperm can fuse with the egg , resulting in polyspermy .","1"
biology," The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days .","0"
biology," 1932 . In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .","0"
biology," Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .","1"
biology," The inner cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo .","1"
biology," 1935 . The outer layers of the zygote ( blastocyst ) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells , and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue .","0"
biology," Another layer of the blastocyst , the chorion , begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin ( β - HCG ) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active .","1"
biology," This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo .","0"
biology," 1938 . Infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth .","1"
biology," About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified ; these include diseases , such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women , or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals .","0"
biology," 1941 . The mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body .","0"
biology," A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between them .","0"
biology," The somites , illustrated in [ link ] will further develop into the ribs , lungs , and segmental ( spine ) muscle .","0"
biology," 1944 . Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource .","0"
biology," Ecologists also study interactions among various species ; members of different species are called heterospecifics .","1"
biology," Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation , parasitism , herbivory , competition , and pollination .","0"
biology," 1947 . Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution .","1"
biology," Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation .","0"
biology," 1950 . The nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year : in the spring and fall turnover .","0"
biology," The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water ( [ link ] ) .","1"
biology," These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline : a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers .","1"
biology," 1953 . Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food ; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration .","1"
biology," In terrestrial environments , net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area , which is the total mass of living plants , excluding roots .","0"
biology," This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement .","0"
biology," 1956 . The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones ( [ link ] ) .","0"
biology," All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .","1"
biology," The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .","1"

history," 2297 . Committed to protecting white workers by keeping slavery out of the lands taken from Mexico , Pennsylvania congressman David Wilmot attached to an 1846 revenue bill an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the new territory .","1"
history," The Wilmot Proviso was not entirely new .","0"
history," Other congressmen had drafted similar legislation , and Wilmot ’s language was largely copied from the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that had banned slavery in that territory .","0"
history," 2300 . Disgusted by the result , the Barnburners united with antislavery Whigs and former members of the Liberty Party to form a new political party — the Free - Soil Party , which took as its slogan “ Free Soil , Free Speech , Free Labor , and Free Men . ”","1"
history," The party had one real goal — to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories ( [ link ] ) .","0"
history," In the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time , southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories .","0"
history," 2303 . In the antebellum era — that is , in the years before the Civil War — American planters in the South continued to grow Chesapeake tobacco and Carolina rice as they had in the colonial era .","1"

history," 2342 . Southern leaders were divided on how to respond to Republican success .","0"
history," Southern extremists , known as “ Fire - Eaters , ” openly called for secession .","1"
history," Others , like Mississippi senator Jefferson Davis , put forward a more moderate approach by demanding constitutional protection of slavery .","0"
history," 2345 . In this way , states could protect themselves , and slavery , from interference by what they perceived to be an overbearing central government .","0"
history," The constitution of the Confederate States of America ( CSA ) , or the Confederacy , drafted at a convention in Montgomery , Alabama , in February 1861 , closely followed the 1787 Constitution .","0"

history," The proclamation did not immediately free the slaves in the Confederate states .","0"
history," 2360 . Many whites in the North found this deeply offensive , since they still believed in racial inequality .","0"

history," While the laws varied in both content and severity from state to state , the goal of the laws remained largely consistent .","0"
history," 2372 . More dispiriting still was the fact that many women ’s rights activists , such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , had played a large part in the abolitionist movement leading up to the Civil War .","0"
history," Following the war , women and men , white and black , formed the American Equal Rights Association ( AERA ) for the expressed purpose of securing “ equal Rights to all American citizens , especially the right of suffrage , irrespective of race , color or sex . ”","1"
history," Two years later , with the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , section 2 of which specifically qualified the liberties it extended to “ male citizens , ” it seemed as though the progress made in support of civil rights was not only passing women by but was purposely codifying their exclusion .","0"

history," Through the City Beautiful movement , leaders such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham sought to champion middle- and upper - class progressive reforms .","0"
history," They improved the quality of life for city dwellers , but also cultivated middle - class - dominated urban spaces in which Americans of different ethnicities , racial origins , and classes worked and lived .","0"
history," 2417 . Other thinkers of the day took Charles Darwin ’s theories in a more nuanced direction , focusing on different theories of realism that sought to understand the truth underlying the changes in the United States .","0"
history," These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted .","0"
history," 2420 . The narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized , crafted , and even fabricated , since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform .","0"

history," 2429 . At the state level , specifically in Wisconsin , Minnesota , Illinois , and Iowa , the Patrons of Husbandry did briefly succeed in urging the passage of Granger Laws , which regulated some railroad rates along with the prices charged by grain elevator operators .","1"
history," The movement also created a political party — the Greenback Party , so named for its support of print currency ( or “ greenbacks ” ) not based upon a gold standard — which saw brief success with the election of fifteen congressmen . However , such successes were short - lived and had little impact on the lives of everyday farmers .","1"

history," 2465 . When William Howard Taft became president in 1909 , he chose to adapt Roosevelt ’s foreign policy philosophy to one that reflected American economic power at the time .","0"
history," In what became known as “ dollar diplomacy , ” Taft announced his decision to “ substitute dollars for bullets ” in an effort to use foreign policy to secure markets and opportunities for American businessmen ( [ link ] ) .","1"

history," While some moved west , the vast majority of this Great Migration , as the large exodus of African Americans leaving the South in the early twentieth century was called , traveled to the Northeast and Upper Midwest .","1"
history," The following cities were the primary destinations for these African Americans : New York , Chicago , Philadelphia , St. Louis , Detroit , Pittsburgh , Cleveland , and Indianapolis .","0"
history," 2418 . These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted .","0"
history," Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models .","1"
history," Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James .","0"
history," 2424 . Two powerful Republican leaders attempted to control the president .","0"
history," The first was Roscoe Conkling , Republican senator from New York and leader of the Stalwarts , a group that strongly supported continuation of the current spoils system ( [ link ] ) .","1"
history," Long supporting former President Grant , Conkling had no sympathy for some of Hayes ’ early appeals for civil service reform .","0"
history," 2427 . Unable to find such a man , the predominant Half - Breeds again turned to their own leader , Senator Blaine .","0"
history," However , when news of his many personal corrupt bargains began to surface , a significant portion of the party chose to break from the traditional Stalwarts - versus - Half - Breeds debate and form their own faction , the Mugwumps , a name taken from the Algonquin phrase for “ great chief . ”","0"
history," 2430 . The Farmers ’ Alliance , a conglomeration of three regional alliances formed in the mid- 1880s , took root in the wake of the Grange movement .","1"
history," In 1890 , Dr. Charles Macune , who led the Southern Alliance , which was based in Texas and had over 100,000 members by 1886 , urged the creation of a national alliance between his organization , the Northwest Alliance , and the Colored Alliance , the largest African American organization in the United States .","1"
history," 2433 . A notable example of the government ’s failure to act was the story of Coxey ’s Army .","0"
history," In the spring of 1894 , businessman Jacob Coxey led a march of unemployed Ohioans from Cincinnati to Washington , DC , where leaders of the group urged Congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects .","1"
history," 2436 . It was not until Theodore Roosevelt unexpectedly became president in 1901 that the federal government would engage in Progressive reforms .","0"
history," Before then , Progressivism was work done by the people , for the people .","0"
history," What knit Progressives together was the feeling that the country was moving at a dangerous pace in a dangerous direction and required the efforts of everyday Americans to help put it back on track .","0"
history," 2439 . Another series of reforms pushed forward by Progressives that sought to sidestep the power of special interests in state legislatures and restore the democratic political process were three election innovations — the initiative , referendum , and recall .","0"
history," The first permitted voters to enact legislation by petitioning to place an idea , or initiative , on the ballot .","1"
history," 2442 . The image below ( [ link ] ) shows a machinist in a factory where Taylor had consulted ; he is alone and focused solely on his job .","0"
history," Progressive in its emphasis on efficiency , the use of science , and the reliance on experts , Taylorism , as scientific management became known , was not widely popular among workers who resented managerial authority and the loss of autonomy over their work .","1"
history," Many workers went on strikes in response , although some favored Taylor ’s methods , since their pay was directly linked to the productivity increases that his methods achieved and since increased efficiency allowed companies to charge consumers lower prices .","0"
history," 2445 . White middle - class reformers were appalled at the violence of race relations in the nation but typically shared the belief in racial characteristics and the superiority of Anglo - Saxon whites over African Americans , Asians , “ ethnic ” Europeans , Indians , and Latin American populations .","0"
history," Southern reformers considered segregation a Progressive solution to racial violence ; across the nation , educated middle - class Americans enthusiastically followed the work of eugenicists who identified virtually all human behavior as inheritable traits and issued awards at county fairs to families and individuals for their “ racial fitness . ”","0"
history," It was against this tide that African American leaders developed their own voice in the Progressive Era , working along diverse paths to improve the lives and conditions of African Americans throughout the country .","0"
history," 2448 . By 1908 , internal fights over the role of women in the fight for African American equal rights lessened the interest in the Niagara Movement .","0"
history," But the movement laid the groundwork for the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , founded in 1909 .","0"
history," Du Bois served as the influential director of publications for the NAACP from its inception until 1933 .","0"
history," 2451 . Although not as flamboyant or outwardly progressive as Roosevelt , Taft ’s organizational skills and generally solid performance as president aligned with the party leadership ’s concerns over another Roosevelt presidency and secured for him the Republican Party ’s nomination .","0"
history," Angry over this snub , in 1912 , Roosevelt and the other Progressive Republicans bolted from the Republican Party and formed the Progressive Party .","0"
history," His popularity had him hoping to win the presidential race as a third - party candidate .","0"
history," 2454 . Fearing future loss of the territory through military conflict , as well as desiring to create challenges for Great Britain ( which they had fought in the Crimean War ) , Russia had happily accepted the American purchase offer .","0"
history," In the United States , several newspaper editors openly questioned the purchase and labeled it “ Seward ’s Folly ” ( [ link ] ) .","0"
history," They highlighted the lack of Americans to populate the vast region and lamented the challenges in attempting to govern the native peoples in that territory .","0"
history," 2457 . Shippers and other businessmen , particularly in the sugar industry , supported American intervention to safeguard their own interests in the region .","0"
history," Likewise , the “ Cuba Libre ” movement founded by José Martí , who quickly established offices in New York and Florida , further stirred American interest in the liberation cause .","0"
history," The difference in this uprising , however , was that supporters saw in the renewed U.S. Navy a force that could be a strong ally for Cuba .","0"
history," 2460 . Domestically , the country was neither unified in their support of the treaty nor in the idea of the United States building an empire at all .","0"
history," Many prominent Americans , including Jane Addams , former President Grover Cleveland , Andrew Carnegie , Mark Twain , and Samuel Gompers , felt strongly that the country should not be pursuing an empire , and , in 1898 , they formed the Anti - Imperialist League to oppose this expansionism .","1"
history," The reasons for their opposition were varied : Some felt that empire building went against the principles of democracy and freedom upon which the country was founded , some worried about competition from foreign workers , and some held the xenophobic viewpoint that the assimilation of other races would hurt the country .","0"
history," 2466 . Carranza refused to work with Wilson and the U.S. government , and instead threatened to defend Mexico ’s mineral rights against all American oil companies established there .","0"
history," Wilson then turned to support rebel forces who opposed Carranza , most notably Pancho Villa ( [ link ] ) .","0"
history," However , Villa lacked the strength in number or weapons to overtake Carranza ; in 1915 , Wilson reluctantly authorized official U.S. recognition of Carranza ’s government .","0"
history," 2469 . The war effort was costly — with an eventual price tag in excess of $ 32 billion by 1920—and the government needed to finance it .","0"
history," The Liberty Loan Act allowed the federal government to sell liberty bonds to the American public , extolling citizens to “ do their part ” to help the war effort and bring the troops home .","1"
history," The government ultimately raised $ 23 billion through liberty bonds .","0"
history," 2472 . First during World War I , then again in World War II , these women stepped up to run farms and other agricultural enterprises , as men left for the armed forces ( [ link ] ) .","1"
history," Known as Farmerettes , some twenty thousand women — mostly college educated and from larger urban areas — served in this capacity .","0"
history," Their reasons for joining were manifold .","0"
history," 2475 . As early as January 1918 — a full five months before U.S. military forces fired their first shot in the war , and eleven months before the actual armistice — Wilson announced his postwar peace plan before a joint session of Congress .","0"
history," Referring to what became known as the Fourteen Points , Wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade , specifically , free trade , freedom of the seas , an end to secret treaties and negotiations , promotion of self - determination of all nations , and more .","1"
history," In addition , he called for the creation of a League of Nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war .","0"
history," 2478 . Meanwhile , southern lynchings continued to escalate , with white mobs burning African Americans at the stake .","0"
history," During the “ Red Summer ” of 1919 , northern cities recorded twenty - five bloody race riots that killed over 250 people .","1"
history," Among these was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 , where a white mob stoned a young black boy to death because he swam too close to the “ white beach ” on Lake Michigan .","1"
history," 2481 . The 1920s opened up new possibilities of mobility for a large percentage of the U.S. population , as automobile manufacturers began to mass produce what had once been a luxury item , and daring aviators both demonstrated and drove advancements in aircraft technology .","0"
history," The most significant innovation of this era was Henry Ford ’s Model T Ford , which made car ownership available to the average American .","0"
history," 2484 . Many of these new immigrants were coming from eastern and southern Europe and , for many English - speaking , native - born Americans of northern European descent , the growing diversity of new languages , customs , and religions triggered anxiety and racial animosity .","0"
history," In reaction , some embraced nativism , prizing white Americans with older family trees over more recent immigrants , and rejecting outside influences in favor of their own local customs .","1"
history," Nativists also stoked a sense of fear over the perceived foreign threat , pointing to the anarchist assassinations of the Spanish prime minister in 1897 , the Italian king in 1900 , and even President William McKinley in 1901 as proof .","0"
history," 2487 . Many Americans were disillusioned in the post - World War I era , and their reactions took many forms .","0"
history," Rebellious American youth , in particular , adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents .","0"
history," Many young women of the era shed their mother ’s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper , the Jazz Age female stereotype , seeking the endless party .","1"
history," 2490 . The law proved difficult to enforce , as illegal alcohol soon poured in from Canada and the Caribbean , and rural Americans resorted to home - brewed “ moonshine . ”","0"
history," The result was an eroding of respect for law and order , as many people continued to drink illegal liquor .","0"
history," Rather than bringing about an age of sobriety , as Progressive reformers had hoped , it gave rise to a new subculture that included illegal importers , interstate smuggling ( or bootlegging ) , clandestine saloons referred to as “ speakeasies , ” hipflasks , cocktail parties , and the organized crime of trafficking liquor .","1"
history," 2493 . Although his critics depicted him as weak , lazy , or incompetent , he was actually quite shrewd and politically astute .","0"
history," Together with his running mate , Calvin Coolidge , the governor of Massachusetts , they attracted the votes of many Americans who sought Harding ’s promised return to normalcy .","0"
history," In the election , Harding defeated Governor James Cox of Ohio by the greatest majority in the history of two - party politics : 61 percent of the popular vote .","0"
history," 2499 . Investors , along with the general public , withdrew their money from banks by the thousands , fearing the banks would go under .","0"
history," The more people pulled out their money in bank runs , the closer the banks came to insolvency ( [ link ] ) .","0"
history," 2502 . In 1932 , a major strike at the Ford Motor Company factory near Detroit resulted in over sixty injuries and four deaths .","0"
history," Often referred to as the Ford Hunger March , the event unfolded as a planned demonstration among unemployed Ford workers who , to protest their desperate situation , marched nine miles from Detroit to the company ’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn .","1"
history," At the Dearborn city limits , local police launched tear gas at the roughly three thousand protestors , who responded by throwing stones and clods of dirt .","0"
history," 2508 . This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’s “ Good Neighbor ” policy .","0"
history," After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930 — which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America .","1"
history," To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U.S. pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs .","1"
history," 2511 . The election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signaled both immediate relief for the American public as well as a permanent shift in the role of the federal government in guiding the economy and providing direct assistance to the people , albeit through expensive programs that made extensive budget deficits commonplace .","0"
history," For many , the immediate relief was , at a minimum , psychological : Herbert Hoover was gone , and the situation could not grow worse under Roosevelt .","0"
history," 2514 . After the landslide election , the country — and Hoover — had to endure the interregnum , the difficult four months between the election and President Roosevelt ’s inauguration in March 1933 .","1"
history," Congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period , although Hoover spent much of the time trying to get Roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of Hoover ’s choosing .","0"
history," 2520 . At its peak , there were some four million Americans repairing bridges , building roads and airports , and undertaking other public projects .","0"
history," Another work program was the Civilian Conservation Corps Relief Act ( CCC ) .","0"
history," The CCC provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty - four who came from relief families .","1"
history," 2523 . Regionally , Roosevelt ’s work was most famously seen in the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) ( [ link ] ) , a federal agency tasked with the job of planning and developing the area through flood control , reforestation , and hydroelectric power .","1"
history," Employing several thousand Americans on a project that Roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment , the TVA revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over - farmed , leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming .","0"
history," 2526 . The Banking Act of 1935 was the most far - reaching revision of banking laws since the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 .","1"
history," Previously , regional reserve banks , particularly the New York Reserve Bank — controlled by the powerful Morgan and Rockefeller families — had dominated policy - making at the Federal Reserve .","0"
history," 2529 . Roosevelt sought to salvage this important piece of labor legislation , doing so with the Wagner Act .","0"
history," The act created the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) to once again protect American workers ’ right to unionize and bargain collectively , as well as to provide a federal vehicle for labor grievances to be heard .","1"
history," Although roundly criticized by the Republican Party and factory owners , the Wagner Act withstood several challenges and eventually received constitutional sanction by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1937 .","0"
history," 2532 . Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .","0"
history," One key figure in the NYA was Mary McLeod Bethune ( [ link ] ) , a prominent African American educator tapped by Roosevelt to act as the director of the NYA ’s Division of Negro Affairs .","0"
history," Bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years ; with this role , she became one of the president ’s foremost African American advisors .","0"
history," 2535 . At a conference in Munich later that year , Great Britain ’s prime minister , Neville Chamberlain , and France ’s prime minister , Édouard Daladier , agreed to the partial dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the occupation of the Sudetenland ( a region with a sizable German population ) by German troops ( [ link ] ) .","1"
history," This Munich Pact offered a policy of appeasement , in the hope that German expansionist appetites could be satisfied without war .","0"
history," But not long after the agreement , Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia as well .","0"
history," 2538 . Both groups ended their opposition , however , at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , respectively .","0"
history," Nevertheless , during the war , some seventy - two thousand men registered as conscientious objectors ( COs ) , and fifty - two thousand were granted that status .","0"
history," Of that fifty - two thousand , some accepted noncombat roles in the military , whereas others accepted unpaid work in civilian work camps .","0"
history," 2541 . After all , they argued , if the United States were going to denounce Germany and Japan for abusing human rights , the country should itself be as exemplary as possible .","0"
history," Indeed , CORE ’s actions were in keeping with the goals of the Double V campaign that was begun in 1942 by the Pittsburgh Courier , the largest African American newspaper at the time ( [ link ] ) .","1"
history," The campaign called upon African Americans to accomplish the two “ Vs ” : victory over America ’s foreign enemies and victory over racism in the United States .","1"
history," 2544 . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in the United States that culminated in the relocation and internment of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , 66 percent of whom had been born in the United States .","0"
history," Executive Order 9066 , signed by Roosevelt on February 19 , 1942 , gave the army power to remove people from “ military areas ” to prevent sabotage or espionage .","1"
history," The army then used this authority to relocate people of Japanese ancestry living along the Pacific coast of Washington , Oregon , and California , as well as in parts of Arizona , to internment camps in the American interior .","0"
history," 2547 . The “ Bataan Death March , ” during which as many as 650 American and 10,000 Filipino prisoners of war died , intensified anti - Japanese feelings .","1"
history," Kamikaze attacks that took place towards the end of the war were regarded as proof of the irrationality of Japanese martial values and mindless loyalty to Emperor Hirohito .","0"
history," 2550 . To counter Soviet influence in the developing world , Kennedy supported a variety of measures .","0"
history," One of these was the Alliance for Progress , which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism .","1"
history," Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid , and he founded the Peace Corps , which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia , Africa , and Latin America .","1"
history," 2553 . The plan was to develop different strategies , tactics , and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium - sized insurgencies , and political or diplomatic crises .","0"
history," One component of flexible response was the Green Berets , a U.S. Army Special Forces unit trained in counterinsurgency — the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations .","1"
history," Much of the Kennedy administration ’s new approach to defense , however , remained focused on the ability and willingness of the United States to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare , and Kennedy continued to call for increases in the American nuclear arsenal .","0"
history," 2556 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , color , national origin , and religion , also prohibited , in Title VII , discrimination on the basis of sex .","1"
history," Ironically , protection for women had been included at the suggestion of a Virginia congressman in an attempt to prevent the act ’s passage ; his reasoning seemed to be that , while a white man might accept that African Americans needed and deserved protection from discrimination , the idea that women deserved equality with men would be far too radical for any of his male colleagues to contemplate .","0"
history," 2562 . For Carmichael , Black Power was the power of African Americans to unite as a political force and create their own institutions apart from white - dominated ones , an idea also espoused in the 1920s by political leader and orator Marcus Garvey .","1"
history," Like Garvey , Carmichael became an advocate of black separatism , arguing that African Americans should live apart from whites and solve their problems for themselves .","1"
history," In keeping with this philosophy , Carmichael expelled SNCC ’s white members .","0"
history," 2565 . Besides demobilizing the armed forces and preparing for the homecoming of servicemen and women , he also had to guide the nation through the process of returning to a peacetime economy .","0"
history," To this end , he proposed an ambitious program of social legislation that included establishing a federal minimum wage , expanding Social Security and public housing , and prohibiting child labor .","0"
history," Wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others , like meat .","0"
history," 2568 . In February 1946 , George Kennan , a State Department official stationed at the U.S. embassy in Moscow , sent an eight - thousand - word message to Washington , DC .","0"
history," In what became known as the “ Long Telegram , ” Kennan maintained that Soviet leaders believed that the only way to protect the Soviet Union was to destroy “ rival ” nations and their influence over weaker nations .","1"
history," According to Kennan , the Soviet Union was not so much a revolutionary regime as a totalitarian bureaucracy that was unable to accept the prospect of a peaceful coexistence of the United States and itself .","0"
history," 2571 . Like dominos toppling one another , entire regions would eventually be controlled by the Soviets .","0"
history," The demand for anti - Communist containment appeared as early as March 1946 in a speech by Winston Churchill , in which he referred to an Iron Curtain that divided Europe into the “ free ” West and the Communist East controlled by the Soviet Union .","0"
history," 2574 . Witnesses were subpoenaed and required to testify before the committee ; refusal could result in imprisonment .","0"
history," Those who invoked Fifth Amendment protections , or were otherwise suspected of Communist sympathies , often lost their jobs or found themselves on a blacklist , which prevented them from securing employment .","0"
history," Notable artists who were blacklisted in the 1940s and 1950s include composer Leonard Bernstein , novelist Dashiell Hammett , playwright and screenwriter Lillian Hellman , actor and singer Paul Robeson , and musician Artie Shaw .","0"
history," 2577 . His New Look strategy embraced nuclear “ massive retaliation , ” a plan for nuclear response to a first Soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond .","1"
history," Some labeled this approach “ Mutually Assured Destruction ” or MAD .","0"
history," 2580 . The growing number of cars on the road changed consumption patterns , and drive - in and drive - through convenience stores , restaurants , and movie theaters began to dot the landscape .","0"
history," The first McDonalds opened in San Bernardino , California , in 1954 to cater to drivers in a hurry .","0"
history," 2583 . Not all efforts to enact desegregation required the use of the courts , however .","0"
history," On April 15 , 1947 , Jackie Robinson started for the Brooklyn Dodgers , playing first base .","0"
history," He was the first African American to play baseball in the National League , breaking the color barrier .","0"
history," 2586 . Many national politicians supported the segregationist efforts .","0"
history," In 1956 , ninety - six members of Congress signed “ The Southern Manifesto , ” in which they accused the U.S. Supreme Court of misusing its power and violating the principle of states ’ rights , which maintained that states had rights equal to those of the federal government .","1"
history," 2589 . “ Hippies ” rejected the conventions of traditional society .","1"
history," Men sported beards and grew their hair long ; both men and women wore clothing from non - Western cultures , defied their parents , rejected social etiquettes and manners , and turned to music as an expression of their sense of self .","0"
history," 2592 . Nixon also courted northern , blue - collar workers , whom he later called the silent majority , to acknowledge their belief that their voices were seldom heard .","1"
history," These voters feared the social changes taking place in the country : Antiwar protests challenged their own sense of patriotism and civic duty , whereas the recreational use of new drugs threatened their cherished principles of self - discipline , and urban riots invoked the specter of a racial reckoning .","0"
history," 2595 . The combination of unemployment and rising prices posed an unfamiliar challenge to economists whose fiscal policies of either expanding or contracting federal spending could only address one side of the problem at the cost of the other .","1"
history," This phenomenon of “ stagflation ” — a term that combined the economic conditions of stagnation and inflation — outlived the Nixon administration , enduring into the early 1980s .","0"
history," 2598 . As the conflict wore on and reports of brutalities increased , the antiwar movement grew in strength .","0"
history," To take the political pressure off himself and his administration , and find a way to exit Vietnam “ with honor , ” Nixon began the process of Vietnamization , turning more responsibility for the war over to South Vietnamese forces by training them and providing American weaponry , while withdrawing U.S. troops from the field .","1"
history," At the same time , however , Nixon authorized the bombing of neighboring Cambodia , which had declared its neutrality , in an effort to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong bases within that country and cut off supply routes between North and South Vietnam .","0"
history," 2601 . In the weeks following the Watergate break - in , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , reporters for The Washington Post , received information from several anonymous sources , including one known to them only as “ Deep Throat , ” that led them to realize the White House was deeply implicated in the break - in .","0"
history," As the press focused on other events , Woodward and Bernstein continued to dig and publish their findings , keeping the public ’s attention on the unfolding scandal .","0"
history," 2604 . After two unsuccessful Republican primary bids in 1968 and 1976 , Reagan won the presidency in 1980 .","0"
history," His victory was the result of a combination of dissatisfaction with the presidential leadership of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s and the growth of the New Right .","0"
history," This group of conservative Americans included many very wealthy financial supporters and emerged in the wake of the social reforms and cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s .","1"
history," 2607 . Much of the intellectual meat of the Reagan Revolution came from conservative think tanks ( policy or advocacy groups ) that specifically sought to shape American political and social dialogues .","0"
history," The Heritage Foundation , one such group , soon became the intellectual arm of the conservative movement .","1"
history," 2610 . Because the disease was seen almost exclusively in male homosexuals , it was quickly dubbed “ gay cancer . ”","0"
history," Doctors soon realized it often coincided with other symptoms , including a rare form of pneumonia , and they renamed it “ Gay Related Immune Deficiency ” ( GRID ) , although people other than gay men , primarily intravenous drug users , were dying from the disease as well .","0"
history," The connection between gay men and GRID — later renamed human immunodeficiency virus / autoimmune deficiency syndrome , or HIV / AIDS — led heterosexuals largely to ignore the growing health crisis in the gay community , wrongly assuming they were safe from its effects .","0"
history," The federal government also overlooked the disease , and calls for more money to research and find the cure were ignored .","0"
history," 2613 . Reagan , however , overlooked the legitimate complaints of the Sandinistas and believed that their rule opened the region to Cuban and Soviet influence .","0"
history," A year into his presidency , convinced it was folly to allow the expansion of Soviet and Communist influence in Latin America , he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to equip and train a group of anti - Sandinista Nicaraguans known as the Contras ( contrarevolucionários or “ counter - revolutionaries ” ) to oust Ortega .","1"
history," 2616 . Soon they were mounting fierce opposition to the bill .","0"
history," Moderate conservatives dubbed the reform proposals “ Hillarycare ” and argued that the bill was an unwarranted expansion of the powers of the federal government that would interfere with people ’s ability to choose the healthcare provider they wanted .","0"
history," Those further to the right argued that healthcare reform was part of a larger and nefarious plot to control the public .","0"
history," 2619 . Lieberman had been quick to denounce Clinton ’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky .","0"
history," Consumer advocate Ralph Nader ran as the candidate of the Green Party , a party devoted to environmental issues and grassroots activism , and Democrats feared that he would attract votes that Gore might otherwise win .","1"
history," 2622 . On September 20 , in an address to a joint session of Congress , Bush declared war on terrorism , blamed al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the attacks , and demanded that the radical Islamic fundamentalists who ruled Afghanistan , the Taliban , turn bin Laden over or face attack by the United States .","1"
history," This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .","1"
history," 2625 . Fearing that terrorists might strike within the nation ’s borders again , and aware of the chronic lack of cooperation among different federal law enforcement agencies , Bush created the Office of Homeland Security in October 2001 .","0"
history," The next year , Congress passed the Homeland Security Act , creating the Department of Homeland Security , which centralized control over a number of different government functions in order to better control threats at home ( [ link ] ) . The Bush administration also pushed the USA Patriot Act through Congress , which enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor citizens ’ e - mails and phone conversations without a warrant .","1"
history," 2628 . In the end , no such weapons were ever found .","0"
history," These criticisms were amplified by growing international concern over the treatment of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and widespread disgust over the torture conducted by U.S. troops at the prison in Abu Ghraib , Iraq , which surfaced only months before the election ( [ link ] ) .","0"
history," 2631 . Even though CDOs consisted of subprime mortgages , credit card debt , and other risky investments , credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe .","0"
history," Making matters worse , financial institutions created instruments called credit default swaps , which were essentially a form of insurance on investments .","1"
history," If the investment lost money , the investors would be compensated .","0"
history," 2634 . This popular denial has had huge global consequences .","0"
history," In 1998 , the United States , which produces roughly 36 percent of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that prevent the earth ’s heat from escaping into space , signed the Kyoto Protocol , an agreement among the world ’s nations to reduce their emissions of these gases .","1"
history," President Bush objected to the requirement that major industrialized nations limit their emissions to a greater extent than other parts of the world and argued that doing so might hurt the American economy .","0"
history," 2637 . With debt upon graduation averaging about $ 29,000 , students may find their economic options limited .","0"
history," Instead of buying cars or paying for housing , they may have to join the boomerang generation and return to their parents ’ homes in order to make their loan payments .","0"
history," Clearly , high levels of debt will affect their career choices and life decisions for the foreseeable future .","0"
physics," 2641 . Although displacement is described in terms of direction , distance is not .","0"
physics," Distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions .","1"

psychology," ( a ) Phineas Gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad construction accident .","0"
psychology," ( b ) Gage ’s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere .","0"
psychology," 3382 . The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .","1"
psychology," The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .","1"
psychology," 3385 . The occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain , and contains the primary visual cortex , which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information .","1"
psychology," The occipital cortex is organized retinotopically , which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person ’s visual field and the position of that object ’s representation on the cortex .","1"
psychology," 3388 . The limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory .","1"
psychology," Interestingly , the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system ; therefore , not surprisingly , smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities can not .","0"
psychology," 3391 . The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .","1"
psychology," The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .","1"
psychology," The hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior .","0"
psychology," 3394 . Midbrain and Hindbrain Structures","0"
psychology," The midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .","1"
psychology," The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .","1"
psychology," The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep / wake cycle , arousal , alertness , and motor activity .","0"
psychology," 3397 . It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .","1"
psychology," The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .","1"
psychology," 3400 . On February 25 , 1990 , a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo went into cardiac arrest , apparently triggered by a bulimic episode .","0"
psychology," She was eventually revived , but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time .","0"
psychology," 3403 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans create pictures of the living , active brain ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," An individual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance , called a tracer .","1"
psychology," 3406 . In some situations , it is helpful to gain an understanding of the overall activity of a person ’s brain , without needing information on the actual location of the activity .","0"
psychology," Electroencephalography ( EEG ) serves this purpose by providing a measure of a brain ’s electrical activity .","1"
psychology," An array of electrodes is placed around a person ’s head ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3409 . Located in the neck , the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth , metabolism , and appetite .","1"
psychology," In hyperthyroidism , or Grave ’s disease , the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine , causing agitation , bulging eyes , and weight loss .","1"
psychology," 3412 . These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .","0"
psychology," People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume . The gonads secrete sexual hormones , which are important in reproduction , and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior .","1"
psychology," The female gonads are the ovaries ; the male gonads are the testes .","1"
psychology," 3415 . Visit this website to see an example of a consent form . While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing , sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants ’ knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study .","0"
psychology," Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment , but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful .","1"
psychology," For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants ’ responses .","0"
psychology," 3418 . Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects .","0"
psychology," Often , these researchers use rodents ( [ link ] ) or birds as the subjects of their experiments — the APA estimates that 90 % of all animal research in psychology uses these species ( American Psychological Association , n. d. ) .","0"
psychology," Because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans , these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants .","1"
psychology," 3421 . We can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient .","0"
psychology," A correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to +1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables .","1"
psychology," The correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter r .","0"
psychology," 3424 . Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables .","1"
psychology," However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .","1"
psychology," While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .","0"
psychology," 3427 . We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations , especially with unsystematic observations .","0"
psychology," Illusory correlations , or false correlations , occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists .","1"
psychology," One well - known illusory correlation is the supposed effect that the moon ’s phases have on human behavior .","0"
psychology," 3430 . In order to conduct an experiment , a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested .","0"
psychology," As you ’ve learned , hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research .","1"
psychology," 3433 . Ideally , the people who observe and record the children ’s behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group , in order to control for experimenter bias .","0"
psychology," Experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher ’s expectations might skew the results of the study .","1"
psychology," Remember , conducting an experiment requires a lot of planning , and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their hypotheses .","0"
psychology," 3436 . Because by doing so , we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations .","0"
psychology," If you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect , you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration .","0"
psychology," The placebo effect occurs when people 's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation .","1"
psychology," 3439 . Our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include .","0"
psychology," Participants are the subjects of psychological research , and as the name implies , individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process .","1"
psychology," Often , psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants .","0"
psychology," 3442 . Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design .","0"
psychology," With sufficiently large samples , random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups .","1"
psychology," 3445 . Poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out , and even well - designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested .","0"
psychology," Peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it , meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability .","1"
psychology," Sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding .","0"
psychology," 3448 . In observational research , scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or just a few individuals .","1"
psychology," Indeed , some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10 – 20 individuals .","0"
psychology," 3451 . The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another .","0"
psychology," The anthropologist Jane Goodall , for example , spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation , some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers — using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study ( McKie , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," 3454 . To protect against this type of bias , researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified .","0"
psychology," In addition , researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers , in order to test inter - rater reliability : a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers .","1"
psychology," 3457 . Instead , they use existing records to answer various research questions .","0"
psychology," This type of research approach is known as archival research .","0"
psychology," Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships .","1"
psychology," 3460 . Even without significant life changes , some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project .","0"
psychology," As a result , the attrition rates , or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts , in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project .","1"
psychology," For this reason , researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end .","0"
psychology," 3463 . In the end , research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions .","0"
psychology," Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .","1"
psychology," In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH","0"
psychology," Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .","0"
psychology," 3466 . We ’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas , but what sort of ideas are they , exactly ?","0"
psychology," A theory is a well - developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena .","1"
psychology," Theories are repeatedly checked against the world , but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once ; instead , researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory .","0"
psychology," 3469 . A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .","1"
psychology," Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," However , a major criticism of Freud ’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable ; for example , it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the i d , the ego , and the superego — the three elements of personality described in Freud ’s theories .","0"
psychology," 3472 . The scientific method is also a form of empiricism .","0"
psychology," An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .","1"
psychology," 3475 . In some areas in psychology , it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty .","0"
psychology," In most cases , young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full - time faculty position .","0"
psychology," 3478 . As the name suggests , biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior .","1"
psychology," While biological psychology is a broad field , many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3481 . As mentioned in the previous section , the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior .","1"
psychology," Thus , cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions , or thoughts , and their relationship to our experiences and our actions .","1"
psychology," Like biological psychology , cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds .","0"
psychology," 3484 . Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique .","1"
psychology," Several individuals ( e.g. , Freud and Maslow ) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology , and the American psychologist Gordon Allport , contributed to early theories of personality .","0"
psychology," 3487 . Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others .","1"
psychology," Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others , prejudice , and attraction , and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts .","1"
psychology," 3490 . Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors .","1"
psychology," This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3493 . Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior .","1"
psychology," As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .","0"
psychology," 3496 . Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system .","1"
psychology," For example , forensic psychologists ( and forensic psychiatrists ) will assess a person ’s competency to stand trial , assess the state of mind of a defendant , act as consultants on child custody cases , consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations , and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children ’s testimony ( American Board of Forensic Psychology , 2014 ) .","0"
psychology," 3499 . These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate “ interpretation ” in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately , since it can not be seen by any other person .","0"
psychology," This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism .","1"
psychology," Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3502 . Perhaps one of the most influential and well - known figures in psychology ’s history was Sigmund Freud ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Freud ( 1856 – 1939 ) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “ hysteria ” and neurosis .","0"
psychology," 3505 . Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov ( 1849 – 1936 ) .","0"
psychology," Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex , in which an animal or human produced a reflex ( unconscious ) response to a stimulus and , over time , was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus .","1"
psychology," 3508 . Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior .","0"
psychology," B. F. Skinner ( 1904 – 1990 ) was an American psychologist ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Like Watson , Skinner was a behaviorist , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences .","0"
psychology," 3511 . Abraham Maslow ( 1908 – 1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here .","0"
psychology," 3514 . Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli .","1"
psychology," Awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain , hunger , thirst , sleepiness , and being aware of our thoughts and emotions .","0"
psychology," 3517 . Biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity .","1"
psychology," A woman ’s menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm — a recurring , cyclical pattern of bodily changes .","0"
psychology," 3520 . In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .","1"
psychology," Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance , or optimal level , within a biological system .","1"
psychology," 3523 . One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .","1"
psychology," The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .","1"
psychology," Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light .","1"
psychology," 3526 . Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .","1"
psychology," These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .","0"
psychology," 3529 . As we grow older , we sleep less .","0"
psychology," In fact , a meta - analysis , which is a study that combines the results of many related studies , conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old , we average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day ( Ohayon , Carskadon , Guilleminault , & Vitiello , 2004 ) .","1"
psychology," As the amount of time we sleep varies over our lifespan , presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly .","0"
psychology," 3532 . Sleep can be divided into two different general phases : REM sleep and non - REM ( NREM ) sleep .","1"
psychology," Rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids .","1"
psychology," Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .","0"
psychology," 3535 . In terms of brain wave activity , stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves .","0"
psychology," The early portion of stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves , which are relatively low frequency ( 8 – 13 Hz ) , high amplitude patterns of electrical activity ( waves ) that become synchronized ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," This pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed , yet awake .","0"
psychology," 3538 . Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," A sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory ( Fogel & Smith , 2011 ; Poe , Walsh , & Bjorness , 2010 ) .","1"
psychology," In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .","0"
psychology," 3541 . The meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time .","0"
psychology," By the late 19th century , German psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious .","0"
psychology," By analyzing dreams , Freud thought people could increase self - awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives .","0"
psychology," 3544 . The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious .","0"
psychology," The collective unconscious , as described by Jung , is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone .","1"
psychology," According to Jung , certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location .","0"
psychology," 3547 . A parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted , disruptive motor activity and/or experiences during sleep play a role .","1"
psychology," Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep .","0"
psychology," 3550 . A person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity or when trying to fall asleep .","1"
psychology," This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs , which , not surprisingly , contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep .","0"
psychology," 3553 . There are two types of sleep apnea : obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea .","0"
psychology," Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .","1"
psychology," In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005 ) .","1"
psychology," One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .","0"
psychology," 3556 . SIDS","0"
psychology," In sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies .","1"
psychology," Infants younger than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS , and boys have a greater risk than girls .","0"
psychology," 3559 . The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ) is used by clinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders .","1"
psychology," Drug use disorders are addictive disorders , and the criteria for specific substance ( drug ) use disorders are described in DSM-5 .","0"
psychology," 3562 . In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .","1"
psychology," Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .","1"
psychology," Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level — even to the point of overdose and death .","0"
psychology," 3565 . Stimulants are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of neural activity .","1"
psychology," Many of these drugs act as agonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system .","0"
psychology," 3568 . While caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug , high blood levels of caffeine can result in insomnia , agitation , muscle twitching , nausea , irregular heartbeat , and even death ( Reissig , Strain , & Griffiths , 2009 ; Wolt , Ganetsky , & Babu , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," In 2012 , Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year - old woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine .","0"
psychology," 3571 . Thus , opioid drugs , which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism , have an extremely high potential for abuse .","0"
psychology," Natural opioids , called opiates , are derivatives of opium , which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant .","1"
psychology," There are now several synthetic versions of opiate drugs ( correctly called opioids ) that have very potent painkilling effects , and they are often abused .","1"
psychology," 3574 . Codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency .","1"
psychology," It is often prescribed for minor pain , and it is available over - the - counter in some other countries .","0"
psychology," 3577 . Meditation is the act of focusing on a single target ( such as the breath or a repeated sound ) to increase awareness of the moment .","1"
psychology," While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated , an individual can perform meditation alone .","1"
psychology," 3580 . The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold .","0"
psychology," Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50 % of the time .","1"
psychology," Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time .","0"
psychology," 3583 . While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment , it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world .","0"
psychology," Perception refers to the way sensory information is organized , interpreted , and consciously experienced .","1"
psychology," Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .","0"
psychology," 3586 . In fact , we often do n’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time .","1"
psychology," This is known as sensory adaptation .","0"
psychology," Imagine entering a classroom with an old analog clock .","0"
psychology," 3589 . The shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception .","0"
psychology," For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .","0"
psychology," One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) :","0"
psychology," The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .","1"
psychology," 3592 . The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .","1"
psychology," Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .","1"
psychology," 3595 . Like light waves , the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound .","0"
psychology," The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound ’s pitch .","1"
psychology," High - frequency sound waves are perceived as high - pitched sounds , while low - frequency sound waves are perceived as low - pitched sounds .","1"
psychology," 3598 . The eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .","1"
psychology," 3601 . When light levels are high , the pupil will constrict , or become smaller , to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye .","1"
psychology," The pupil ’s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the iris , which is the colored portion of the eye .","0"
psychology," 3604 . The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .","1"
psychology," The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .","0"
psychology," 3607 . Rods and cones are connected ( via several interneurons ) to retinal ganglion cells .","0"
psychology," Axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve .","1"
psychology," The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .","1"
psychology," 3610 . Normal - sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision .","0"
psychology," Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light .","0"
psychology," 3613 . Another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages .","0"
psychology," An afterimage describes the continuation of a visual sensation after removal of the stimulus .","1"
psychology," For example , when you stare briefly at the sun and then look away from it , you may still perceive a spot of light although the stimulus ( the sun ) has been removed .","0"
psychology," 3616 . Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .","1"
psychology," One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .","1"
psychology," To experience this slightly different view , do this simple exercise : extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger .","0"
psychology," 3625 . The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies .","1"
psychology," More specifically , the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies .","0"
psychology," 3628 . If a sound comes from an off - center location , it creates two types of binaural cues : interaural level differences and interaural timing differences .","0"
psychology," Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .","1"
psychology," Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3631 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .","1"
psychology," Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .","1"
psychology," Many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age , genetic predisposition , or environmental effects , including exposure to extreme noise ( noise - induced hearing loss , as shown in [ link ] ) , certain illnesses ( such as measles or mumps ) , or damage due to toxins ( such as those found in certain solvents and metals ) .","0"
psychology," 3634 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .","1"
psychology," One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .","0"
psychology," Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," 3637 . In the United States and other places around the world , deaf people have their own language , schools , and customs .","1"
psychology," This is called deaf culture .","0"
psychology," In the United States , deaf individuals often communicate using American Sign Language ( ASL ) ; ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures .","1"
psychology," 3640 . Umami is our fifth taste .","0"
psychology," Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy , and it is associated with a taste for monosodium glutamate ( Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch , 2009 ) .","1"
psychology," There is also a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food ( Mizushige , Inoue , & Fushiki , 2007 ) .","0"
psychology," 3643 . Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor , chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb : a bulb - like structure at the tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin .","1"
psychology," From the olfactory bulb , information is sent to regions of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex , which is located very near the gustatory cortex ( Lodovichi & Belluscio , 2012 ; Spors et al . , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," 3646 . Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .","1"
psychology," Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .","0"
psychology," 3649 . As a result , pain signals that are sent to the brain get exaggerated .","1"
psychology," This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain .","0"
psychology," Multiple treatment options for pain relief range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation .","0"

psychology," The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3661 . In this chapter , you have learned that perception is a complex process .","0"
psychology," Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .","1"
psychology," Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .","0"
psychology," 3667 . Does the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell ?","0"
psychology," Even if you are new to the study of psychology , chances are that you have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs .","0"
psychology," 3670 . In Pavlov ’s experiments , the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them .","0"
psychology," The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .","1"
psychology," The dogs ’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .","1"
psychology," 3679 . When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger ’s food again , Tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her food — she would get excited and run to the kitchen when she heard the sound .","0"
psychology," The behavior of Pavlov ’s dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called spontaneous recovery : the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period ( [ link]).This is the curve of acquisition , extinction , and spontaneous recovery .","1"
psychology," The rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus ( acquisition ) .","0"
psychology," 3682 . But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound , and you continue to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound , she will quickly learn to discriminate between the two sounds ( provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart).Sometimes , classical conditioning can lead to habituation .","0"
psychology," Habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change .","1"
psychology," As the stimulus occurs over and over , we learn not to focus our attention on it .","0"
psychology," 3685 . Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited , and it does n’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike .","1"
psychology," He proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about .","0"
psychology," 3688 . The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement .","0"
psychology," In positive reinforcement , a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior .","1"
psychology," 3691 . In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .","0"
psychology," In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .","1"
psychology," An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class .","0"
psychology," 3694 . How about Joaquin , the soccer player ?","0"
psychology," If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal , you would be using a primary reinforcer .","0"
psychology," Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities .","1"
psychology," 3697 . Watch this video clip where veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shapes a dog ’s behavior using the steps outlined above . Once a behavior is trained , researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule — partial reinforcement .","0"
psychology," In partial reinforcement , also referred to as intermittent reinforcement , the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior .","1"
psychology," There are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3700 . With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded .","0"
psychology," Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store , and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses .","0"
psychology," 3703 . He also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze .","0"
psychology," As the unreinforced rats explored the maze , they developed a cognitive map : a mental picture of the layout of the maze ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement , food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze .","0"
psychology," 3706 . In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .","1"
psychology," The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .","1"
psychology," Research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron , called a mirror neuron ( Hickock , 2010 ; Rizzolatti , Fadiga , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2002 ; Rizzolatti , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2006 ) .","0"
psychology," 3709 . If you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior , you will be more motivated to copy her .","1"
psychology," This is known as vicarious reinforcement .","0"
psychology," On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .","0"
psychology," 3712 . This is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition .","0"
psychology," Simply put , cognition is thinking , and it encompasses the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .","1"
psychology," Scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing ( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," 3715 . Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed .","0"
psychology," A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .","1"
psychology," For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .","0"
psychology," 3718 . A schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts ( Bartlett , 1932 ) .","1"
psychology," There are many different types of schemata , and they all have one thing in common : schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently .","0"
psychology," 3721 . Language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to transmit information from one individual to another .","1"
psychology," While language is a form of communication , not all communication is language .","0"
psychology," 3724 . Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language .","0"
psychology," A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .","1"
psychology," Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .","1"
psychology," 3727 . Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .","1"
psychology," Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," 3730 . Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules .","0"
psychology," This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization .","0"
psychology," In this context , overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule .","1"
psychology," 3733 . Another type of strategy is an algorithm .","0"
psychology," An algorithm is a problem - solving formula that provides you with step - by - step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome ( Kahneman , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed .","0"
psychology," 3736 . The person is stuck — but she just needs to go to another doorway , instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway .","0"
psychology," A mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now .","1"
psychology," 3739 . An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .","1"
psychology," In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .","1"
psychology," For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .","0"
psychology," 3742 . Finally , the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example , information , or recent experience that is that readily available to you , even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision .","1"
psychology," Biases tend to “ preserve that which is already established — to maintain our preexisting knowledge , beliefs , attitudes , and hypotheses ” ( Aronson , 1995 ; Kahneman , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," These biases are summarized in [ link ] .","0"
psychology," 3748 . Interestingly , drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage .","1"
psychology," A habit is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage .","1"
psychology," Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive , we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future ( Graham & Weiner , 1996 ) .","0"
psychology," 3757 . Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations .","0"
psychology," Sternberg says that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze , evaluate , judge , compare , and contrast .","1"
psychology," 3760 . Gardner ’s inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type : emotional intelligence .","0"
psychology," Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others , show empathy , understand social relationships and cues , and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally appropriate ways ( Parker , Saklofske , & Stough , 2009 ) .","1"
psychology," People with high emotional intelligence typically have well - developed social skills .","0"
psychology," 3766 . As blood glucose levels increase , the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating ( Drazen & Woods , 2003 ; Druce , Small , & Bloom , 2004 ; Greary , 1990 ) .","0"
psychology," The food ’s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain ( Woods , 2004 ) , and fat cells release leptin , a satiety hormone .","1"
psychology," 3769 . This observation led some to propose a set - point theory of body weight regulation .","0"
psychology," The set - point theory asserts that each individual has an ideal body weight , or set point , which is resistant to change .","1"
psychology," This set - point is genetically predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set - point are resisted by compensatory changes in energy intake and/or expenditure ( Speakman et al . , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," 3772 . People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .","0"
psychology," Morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI over 40 .","1"
psychology," Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the CDC , and other groups , its value as an assessment tool has been questioned .","0"
psychology," 3775 . People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate for the large amount of food consumed .","1"
psychology," Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors .","0"
psychology," 3778 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .","1"
psychology," Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .","1"
psychology," Like bulimia nervosa , anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes : bone loss , heart failure , kidney failure , amenorrhea ( cessation of the menstrual period ) , reduced function of the gonads , and in extreme cases , death .","0"
psychology," 3781 . MASTERS AND JOHNSON ’S RESEARCHIn 1966 , William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of nearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior .","0"
psychology," Unlike Kinsey , who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data , Masters and Johnson observed people having intercourse in a variety of positions , and they observed people masturbating , manually or with the aid of a device .","0"
psychology," 3784 . The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .","1"
psychology," During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .","0"
psychology," Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .","0"
psychology," 3787 . While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .","0"
psychology," The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm .","1"
psychology," In men , the duration of the refractory period can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes and others as long as a day .","0"
psychology," 3790 . This involves dressing in opposite - sex clothing and assuming an opposite - sex identity .","0"
psychology," These individuals may also undertake transgender hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex , and in some cases , they elect to have surgeries to alter the appearance of their external genitalia to resemble that of their gender identity ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," While these may sound like drastic changes , gender dysphoric individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a mistake of nature , and they seek to correct this mistake .","0"
psychology," 3793 . Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .","1"
psychology," Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .","1"
psychology," The resulting data provide norms , or referential scores , by which to interpret future scores .","0"
psychology," 3796 . The average IQ score on an IQ test is 100 .","0"
psychology," Standard deviations describe how data are dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets .","1"
psychology," The bell curve uses the standard deviation to show how all scores are dispersed from the average score ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3799 . Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup .","1"
psychology," According to this idea , your genetic potential is a fixed quantity , but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience , especially in childhood .","0"
psychology," 3802 . As we move through our daily lives , we experience a variety of emotions .","0"
psychology," An emotion is a subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings .","1"
psychology," The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably , but psychologists use these words to refer to two different things .","0"
psychology," 3808 . The assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone .","0"
psychology," A polygraph , or lie detector test , measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions .","1"
psychology," Someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers .","0"
psychology," 3811 . AmygdalaThe amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions , especially fear and anxiety ( Blackford & Pine , 2012 ; Goosens & Maren , 2002 ; Maren , Phan , & Liberzon , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3817 . Or does being happy make you smile ?","0"
psychology," The facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions , meaning that smiling can make you feel happier ( Buck , 1980 ; Soussignan , 2001 ; Strack , Martin , & Stepper , 1988 ) .","1"
psychology," Recent research explored how Botox , which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression , might affect emotion .","1"
psychology," 3820 . Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids ( “ humors ” ) of the body : choleric temperament ( yellow bile from the liver ) , melancholic temperament ( black bile from the kidneys ) , sanguine temperament ( red blood from the heart ) , and phlegmatic temperament ( white phlegm from the lungs ) ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Eysenck & Eysenck , 1985 ; Lecci & Magnavita , 2013 ; Noga , 2007 ) .","1"
psychology," Centuries later , the influential Greek physician and philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates ’s theory , suggesting that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments .","1"
psychology," For example , the choleric person is passionate , ambitious , and bold ; the melancholic person is reserved , anxious , and unhappy ; the sanguine person is joyful , eager , and optimistic ; and the phlegmatic person is calm , reliable , and thoughtful ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ) .","0"
psychology," 3829 . When certain events , feelings , or yearnings cause an individual anxiety , the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety .","0"
psychology," To do that , the individual ’s unconscious mind uses ego defense mechanisms , unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety .","1"
psychology," The ego , usually conscious , resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety .","1"
psychology," 3835 . In each psychosexual stage of development , the child ’s pleasure - seeking urges , coming from the i d , are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone .","0"
psychology," The stages are oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital ( [ link]).Freud ’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial .","0"
psychology," 3838 . Freud ’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage ( 3–6 years ) , corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls .","1"
psychology," The erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals .","0"
psychology," 3841 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .","1"
psychology," 3844 . As an art school dropout with an uncertain future , young Erik Erikson met Freud ’s daughter , Anna Freud , while he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna .","0"
psychology," It was Anna Freud who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis .","0"
psychology," 3847 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) .","1"
psychology," These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .","1"
psychology," Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over , such as facing death , becoming independent , and striving for mastery .","0"
psychology," 3850 . We get information into our brains through a process called encoding , which is the input of information into the memory system .","1"
psychology," Once we receive sensory information from the environment , our brains label or code it .","0"
psychology," 3856 . Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage .","0"
psychology," Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .","1"
psychology," In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .","0"
psychology," 3865 . ( Note : Sometimes , but not always , the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably .","0"
psychology," ) Implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness .","1"
psychology," They are memories formed from behaviors .","0"
psychology," 3868 . Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about language .","1"
psychology," An example would be the question “ what does argumentative mean ? ” Stored in our semantic memory is knowledge about words , concepts , and language - based knowledge and facts .","0"
psychology," For example , answers to the following questions are stored in your semantic memory :","0"
psychology," 3871 . Very few people can recall events in this way ; right now , only 12 known individuals have this ability , and only a few have been studied ( Parker , Cahill & McGaugh 2006 ) .","0"
psychology," And although hyperthymesia normally appears in adolescence , two children in the United States appear to have memories from well before their tenth birthdays .","0"
psychology," 3874 . For example , you would use recall for an essay test .","0"
psychology," Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again .","1"
psychology," It involves a process of comparison .","0"
psychology," 3880 . Although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories , you could still lose it and be able to create implicit memories ( procedural memory , motor learning , and classical conditioning ) , thanks to your cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," For example , one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air .","0"
psychology," 3889 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .","1"
psychology," Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .","1"
psychology," 3892 . AMNESIAAmnesia is the loss of long - term memory that occurs as the result of disease , physical trauma , or psychological trauma .","1"
psychology," Psychologist Tulving ( 2002 ) and his colleagues at the University of Toronto studied K. C. for years .","0"
psychology," 3895 . The formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction , and the process of bringing up old memories is called reconstruction .","1"
psychology," Yet as we retrieve our memories , we also tend to alter and modify them .","0"
psychology," 3898 . Contrast the Cotton case with what happened in the Elizabeth Smart case .","0"
psychology," When Elizabeth was 14 years old and fast asleep in her bed at home , she was abducted at knifepoint .","0"
psychology," 3901 . “ I ’ve a grand memory for forgetting , ” quipped Robert Louis Stevenson .","0"
psychology," Forgetting refers to loss of information from long - term memory .","1"
psychology," We all forget things , like a loved one ’s birthday , someone ’s name , or where we put our car keys .","0"
psychology," 3904 . You probably answered yes to at least one , if not all , of these examples — but do n’t worry , you are not alone .","0"
psychology," We are all prone to committing the memory error known as absentmindedness .","0"
psychology," These lapses in memory are caused by breaks in attention or our focus being somewhere else . Cynthia , a psychologist , recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness .","1"
psychology," 3907 . How about a memory of a traumatic event , something you really do not want to think about ?","0"
psychology," When you keep remembering something , to the point where you ca n’t “ get it out of your head ” and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things , it is called persistence .","1"
psychology," It ’s Schacter ’s seventh and last memory error .","0"
psychology," 3910 . As the “ third force ” in psychology , humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of psychoanalysis , with its emphasis on psychological disturbance , and to the behaviorists ’ view of humans passively reacting to the environment , which has been criticized as making people out to be personality - less robots .","1"
psychology," It does not suggest that psychoanalytic , behaviorist , and other points of view are incorrect but argues that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience , and fail to recognize the innate capacity for self - directed change and transforming personal experiences .","0"
psychology," 3913 . Rogers further divided the self into two categories : the ideal self and the real self .","0"
psychology," The ideal self is the person that you would like to be ; the real self is the person you actually are .","1"
psychology," Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves .","0"
psychology," 3916 . What are some everyday ways we can improve our memory , including recall ?","0"
psychology," To help make sure information goes from short - term memory to long - term memory , you can use memory - enhancing strategies .","1"
psychology," One strategy is rehearsal , or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered ( Craik & Watkins , 1973 ) .","0"
psychology," 3919 . Try this fun activity that employs a memory - enhancing strategy .","0"
psychology," You could also enhance memory by using elaborative rehearsal : a technique in which you think about the meaning of the new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory ( Tigner , 1999 ) .","1"
psychology," For example , in this case , you could remember that 520 is an area code for Arizona and the person you met is from Arizona .","0"
psychology," 3925 . Across these three domains — physical , cognitive , and psychosocial — the normative approach to development is also discussed .","0"
psychology," This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ”","0"
psychology," In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) .","0"
psychology," 3928 . Continuous development views development as a cumulative process , gradually improving on existing skills ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," With this type of development , there is gradual change .","0"
psychology," 3931 . In the field of behavioral genetics , the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart — a well - known study of the genetic basis for personality — conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999 .","1"
psychology," In studying 350 pairs of twins , including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart , researchers found that identical twins , whether raised together or apart , have very similar personalities ( Bouchard , 1994 ; Bouchard , Lykken , McGue , Segal , & Tellegen , 1990 ; Segal , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," 3934 . Sigmund Freud ( 1856 – 1939 ) believed that personality develops during early childhood .","0"
psychology," For Freud , childhood experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults .","0"
psychology," 3937 . Erik Erikson ( 1902 – 1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .","0"
psychology," Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .","1"
psychology," While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood , Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan .","0"
psychology," 3943 . Young children put objects in their mouths to see if the items are edible , and once they can grasp objects , they may shake or bang them to see if they make sounds .","0"
psychology," Between 5 and 8 months old , the child develops object permanence , which is the understanding that even if something is out of sight , it still exists ( Bogartz , Shinskey , & Schilling , 2000 ) .","1"
psychology," According to Piaget , young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight .","0"
psychology," 3946 . During this stage , we also expect children to display egocentrism , which means that the child is not able to take the perspective of others .","1"
psychology," A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees , thinks , and feels just as they do .","0"
psychology," 3949 . The fourth , and last , stage in Piaget ’s theory is the formal operational stage , which is from about age 11 to adulthood .","0"
psychology," Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete events , children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations .","1"
psychology," 3952 . Social psychology examines how people affect one another , and it looks at the power of the situation .","1"
psychology," Social psychologists assert that an individual ’s thoughts , feelings , and behaviors are very much influenced by social situations .","1"
psychology," 3955 . Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or behavior over others .","0"
psychology," Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings .","1"
psychology," In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .","1"
psychology," 3958 . They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables , and thus to the person ’s state .","1"
psychology," This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error ( Ross , 1977 ; Riggio & Garcia , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," To better understand , imagine this scenario : Greg returns home from work , and upon opening the front door his wife happily greets him and inquires about his day .","0"
psychology," 3961 . You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time — a situational explanation .","0"
psychology," The actor - observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people ’s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental attribution error ) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces ( Jones & Nisbett , 1971 ; Nisbett , Caputo , Legant , & Marecek , 1973 ; Choi & Nisbett , 1998 ) .","1"
psychology," As actors of behavior , we have more information available to explain our own behavior .","0"
psychology," 3964 . A common ideology , or worldview , in the United States is the just - world hypothesis .","0"
psychology," The just - world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve ( Lerner & Miller , 1978 ) .","1"
psychology," In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place , people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes , and bad people experience negative outcomes ( Jost , Banaji , & Nosek , 2004 ; Jost & Major , 2001 ) .","0"

psychology," Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .","1"
psychology," Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .","1"
psychology," 3979 . He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child ( 1988 ) .","0"
psychology," A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings .","1"
psychology," Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment : The caregiver must be responsive to the child ’s physical , social , and emotional needs ; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions ( Bowlby , 1969 ) ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3982 . In cases of resistant attachment , children tend to show clingy behavior , but then they reject the attachment figure ’s attempts to interact with them ( Ainsworth & Bell , 1970 ) .","1"
psychology," These children do not explore the toys in the room , as they are too fearful .","0"
psychology," 3985 . In authoritarian style , the parent places high value on conformity and obedience .","1"
psychology," The parents are often strict , tightly monitor their children , and express little warmth .","0"
psychology," 3988 . As you can see , parenting styles influence childhood adjustment , but could a child ’s temperament likewise influence parenting ?","0"

psychology," Children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions , adapt well to change , and are capable of regulating their emotions .","0"
psychology," 3991 . Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .","0"
psychology," Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .","1"
psychology," Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .","1"
psychology," 3994 . Cognitive empathy , also known as theory - of - mind ( which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism ) , relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others ( Shamay - Tsoory , Tomer , & Aharon - Peretz , 2005 ) .","1"
psychology," Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance .","0"

psychology," Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) .","1"
psychology," Festinger ’s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self - perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) .","1"
psychology," 4009 . Besides the classic military example and group initiation , can you think of other examples of cognitive dissonance ?","0"

psychology," Out of this work came a model called the Yale attitude change approach , which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes .","0"
psychology," Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message , the content of the message , and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message ( Hovland , Janis , & Kelley , 1953 ) .","0"
psychology," 4015 . The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) .","1"
psychology," Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement .","0"
psychology," 4018 . The remaining members of the group were confederates of the researcher .","0"
psychology," A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the researcher .","1"
psychology," Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design , and the true , naïve participants believe that confederates are , like them , uninformed participants in the experiment .","0"
psychology," 4021 . The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret , so we are not coerced by others ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The Asch effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something .","0"
psychology," For example , if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess , no homework , or candy , once a few children vote , the rest will comply and go with the majority .","0"
psychology," 4024 . Another form of social influence is obedience to authority .","0"
psychology," Obedience is the change of an individual ’s behavior to comply with a demand by an authority figure .","1"
psychology," People often comply with the request because they are concerned about a consequence if they do not comply .","0"
psychology," 4027 . Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink .","0"
psychology," Groupthink is the modification of the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus ( Janis , 1972 ) .","1"

psychology," Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype — that is , a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group , regardless of their individual characteristics .","1"
psychology," Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group .","0"
psychology," 4045 . Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex .","1"

psychology," 4057 . Humans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person .","0"
psychology," Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .","1"
psychology," 4060 . For example , women may express their aggression covertly , for example , by communication that impairs the social standing of another person .","0"
psychology," Another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory ( Dollard , Doob , Miller , Mowrer , & Sears , 1939 ) .","0"
psychology," This theory states that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal , they become frustrated and aggressive .","1"
psychology," 4063 . With the rapid growth of technology , and widely available mobile technology and social networking media , a new form of bullying has emerged : cyberbullying ( Hoff & Mitchell , 2009 ) .","0"

psychology," What is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert , concealed , done in private , and the bully can remain anonymous .","0"
psychology," 4066 . Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation .","0"
psychology," Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) .","1"
psychology," Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police .","0"

psychology," 4105 . One of the methods used to reduce accidents in the workplace is a checklist .","0"
psychology," The airline industry is one industry that uses checklists .","0"
psychology," 4108 . A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .","1"
psychology," A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .","0"
psychology," 4111 . The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal : judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor , as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be ( Lyon , 2012 ) ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," As you may recall from what you learned about self - efficacy , an individual ’s belief in his ability to complete a task is important ( Bandura , 1994 ) .","1"
psychology," 4117 . Selye and the General Adaptation SyndromeAnother important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye , mentioned earlier .","0"
psychology," He would eventually become one of the world ’s foremost experts in the study of stress ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4120 . If exposure to a stressor is prolonged , the organism will enter the stage of resistance .","0"
psychology," During this stage , the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor .","1"
psychology," 4123 . The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body .","0"
psychology," Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight .","1"
psychology," However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system .","0"
psychology," 4126 . As our society becomes increasingly multiethnic and multiracial , mental health professionals must develop cultural competence ( [ link ] ) , which means they must understand and address issues of race , culture , and ethnicity .","1"
psychology," They must also develop strategies to effectively address the needs of various populations for which Eurocentric therapies have limited application ( Sue , 2004 ) .","0"
psychology," 4129 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .","0"
psychology," They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .","1"
psychology," Many life events that most people would consider pleasant ( e.g. , holidays , retirement , marriage ) are among those listed on the SRRS ; these are examples of eustress .","0"
psychology," 4132 . Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse , they seem to share two common denominators : heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job .","0"
psychology," Both of these factors contribute to job strain , a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control ( Karasek & Theorell , 1990 ) .","1"
psychology," Clearly , many occupations other than the ones listed in [ link ] involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control ( e.g. , inability to decide when to take breaks ) .","0"
psychology," 4135 . Frequently , a person who is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol has an additional psychological disorder .","0"
psychology," Saying a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has two or more diagnoses .","1"

psychology," 4138 . Physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional factors are called psychophysiological disorders .","1"
psychology," The physical symptoms of psychophysiological disorders are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors ( hence the psycho and physiological in psychophysiological ) .","0"
psychology," 4141 . The question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivated researchers for over three decades , and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face of health psychology ( Kiecolt - Glaser , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning .","1"
psychology," The term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981 , when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed available evidence for associations between the brain , endocrine system , and immune system ( Zacharie , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," 4144 . The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system .","1"
psychology," For many years , disorders that involve the cardiovascular system — known as cardiovascular disorders — have been a major focal point in the study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system ’s centrality in the stress response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .","1"
psychology," Heart disease is one such condition .","0"
psychology," 4147 . Also , one investigation followed over 1,000 male medical students from 32 to 48 years .","0"
psychology," At the beginning of the study , these men completed a questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure ; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger , whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger .","0"
psychology," Decades later , researchers found that those who earlier had indicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age 55 , and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the same age ( Chang , Ford , Meoni , Wang , & Klag , 2002 ) .","0"
psychology," 4150 . Asthma is a chronic and serious disease in which the airways of the respiratory system become obstructed , leading to great difficulty expelling air from the lungs .","1"
psychology," The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the airways ( leading to thickening of the airway walls ) and a tightening of the muscles around them , resulting in a narrowing of the airways ( [ link ] ) ( American Lung Association , 2010 ) .","1"
psychology," 4156 . Family therapy is a special form of group therapy , consisting of one or more families .","1"

psychology," Psychotherapy is a psychological treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems , or to attain personal growth .","1"
psychology," In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .","0"
psychology," 4162 . In a psychoanalyst ’s office , you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories , and the therapist using various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," In free association , the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment .","1"
psychology," However , Freud felt that the ego would at times try to block , or repress , unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free association .","0"
psychology," 4165 . Today , Freud ’s psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent theories and methodologies : the psychodynamic perspective .","0"
psychology," This approach to therapy remains centered on the role of people ’s internal drives and forces , but treatment is less intensive than Freud ’s original model .","0"
psychology," 4168 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .","1"
psychology," In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .","1"
psychology," Therapists with this orientation believe that dysfunctional behaviors , like phobias and bedwetting , can be changed by teaching clients new , more constructive behaviors .","0"
psychology," 4171 . In exposure therapy , a therapist seeks to treat clients ’ fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or situation that causes their problem , with the idea that they will eventually get used to it .","1"
psychology," This can be done via reality , imagination , or virtual reality .","0"
psychology," 4174 . One popular operant conditioning intervention is called the token economy .","0"
psychology," This involves a controlled setting where individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens , such as a poker chip , that can be exchanged for items or privileges .","1"
psychology," 4177 . PSYCHOTHERAPY : COGNITIVE - BEHAVIORAL THERAPYCognitive - behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient ’s childhood or past , as in other forms of psychotherapy .","1"
psychology," One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .","1"
psychology," Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .","1"

psychology," Coping refers to mental and behavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress , including its presumed cause and the unpleasant feelings and emotions it produces .","1"
psychology," 4189 . As cogently described in his statement , our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things .","0"
psychology," Perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major implications for our health and happiness ( Infurna & Gerstorf , 2014 ) .","1"
psychology," Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well - being ( Diehl & Hay , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," 4192 . While having social support is quite beneficial , being the recipient of prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors is associated with a number of negative outcomes .","0"
psychology," In their literature review , Brondolo , Brady , Pencille , Beatty , and Contrada ( 2009 ) describe how racial prejudice and discrimination serve as unique , significant stressors for those who are the targets of such attitudes and behavior .","0"
psychology," Being the target of racism is associated with increased rates of depression , lowered self - esteem , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease .","0"
psychology," 4195 . In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .","0"
psychology," The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :","1"
psychology," 4198 . Although the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating , it is — admittedly — somewhat of a grim topic .","0"
psychology," Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat and encouraging approach to human affairs — the quest for happiness .","0"
psychology," 4201 . In 1998 , Seligman ( the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier ) , who was then president of the American Psychological Association , urged psychologists to focus more on understanding how to build human strength and psychological well - being .","0"
psychology," In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," 4204 . In terms of our health , the expression , “ do n’t worry , be happy ” is helpful advice indeed .","0"
psychology," There has also been much work suggesting that optimism — the general tendency to look on the bright side of things — is also a significant predictor of positive health outcomes .","1"
psychology," 4207 . In the late 1700s , a French physician , Philippe Pinel , argued for more humane treatment of the mentally ill .","0"

psychology," A recent survey of parents , for example , found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern ( Kennedy , LaVail , Nowak , Basket , & Landry , 2011 ) ; and perhaps fearing that their children would develop autism , more than 10 % of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," Some parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine - autism link .","0"
psychology," 4219 . The memory impairments are not caused by ordinary forgetting .","0"
psychology," Some individuals with dissociative amnesia will also experience dissociative fugue ( from the word “ to flee ” in French ) , whereby they suddenly wander away from their home , experience confusion about their identity , and sometimes even adopt a new identity ( Cardeña & Gleaves , 2006 ) .","1"
psychology," Most fugue episodes last only a few hours or days , but some can last longer .","0"
psychology," 4222 . Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person .","1"
psychology," Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) .","1"
psychology," A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream , or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal .","0"
psychology," 4228 . These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person .","1"
psychology," People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important .","1"
psychology," For example , the person who claims to be Jesus Christ , or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years , or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions .","0"

Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .","1"
psychology," In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .","1"
psychology," 4234 . Interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings : drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia - like symptoms , and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms ( Howes & Kapur , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia ( Snyder , 1976 ) .","1"
psychology," More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways .","0"
psychology," 4237 . Early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions .","0"
psychology," A new approach involves identifying people who show minor symptoms of psychosis , such as unusual thought content , paranoia , odd communication , delusions , problems at school or work , and a decline in social functioning — which are coined prodromal symptoms — and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder .","0"
psychology," A number of factors have been identified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder : genetic risk ( a family history of psychosis ) , recent deterioration in functioning , high levels of unusual thought content , high levels of suspicion or paranoia , poor social functioning , and a history of substance abuse ( Fusar - Poli et al . , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," 4240 . The term personality refers loosely to one ’s stable , consistent , and distinctive way of thinking about , feeling , acting , and relating to the world .","1"
psychology," People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs markedly from the expectations of their culture , is pervasive and inflexible , begins in adolescence or early adulthood , and causes distress or impairment ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," Generally , individuals with these disorders exhibit enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact .","0"
psychology," 4243 . People with these disorders usually are impulsive , overly dramatic , highly emotional , and erratic .","0"
psychology," Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder , dependent personality disorder , and obsessive - compulsive personality disorder ( which is not the same thing as obsessive - compulsive disorder ) .","1"
psychology," People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful .","0"
psychology," 4246 . Mood disorders ( [ link ] ) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions — most often depression , but also mania and elation ( Rothschild , 1999 ) .","1"
psychology," All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and emotional states , and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives .","0"
psychology," 4252 . These subtypes — what the DSM-5 refer to as specifiers — are not specific disorders ; rather , they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present .","0"
psychology," One subtype , seasonal pattern , applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a particular time of year ( e.g. , fall or winter ) .","1"
psychology," In everyday language , people often refer to this subtype as the winter blues .","0"
psychology," 4255 . A person with bipolar disorder ( commonly known as manic depression ) often experiences mood states that vacillate between depression and mania ; that is , the person ’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional extreme to the other ( in contrast to unipolar , which indicates a persistently sad mood ) .","1"
psychology," 4258 . If so , what might such predispositions be ?","0"
psychology," A study by Caspi and others ( 2003 ) suggests that an alteration in a specific gene that regulates serotonin ( the 5-HTTLPR gene ) might be one culprit .","0"
psychology," These investigators found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions .","0"
psychology," 4261 . This theory , which focuses on rumination in the development of depression , was first described in the late 1980s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1987 ) .","0"
psychology," Rumination is the repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms , rather that distracting one ’s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active , problem - solving manner ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1991 ) .","1"
psychology," When people ruminate , they have thoughts such as “ Why am I so unmotivated ?","0"
psychology," 4264 . Obsessive - compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve intrusive , unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors .","0"
psychology," Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time to time ( e.g. , craving double cheeseburgers when dieting ) , and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on occasion ( e.g. , pacing when nervous ) .","0"
psychology," 4267 . Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," Compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing , cleaning , checking ( e.g. , that a door is locked ) , and ordering ( e.g. , lining up all the pencils in a particular way ) , and they also include such mental acts as counting , praying , or reciting something to oneself ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Compulsions characteristic of OCD are not performed out of pleasure , nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event .","0"
psychology," 4270 . A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex ( Kopell & Greenberg , 2008 ) , an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision - making ( Rushworth , Noonan , Boorman , Walton , & Behrens , 2011 ) ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," In people with OCD , the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which , for example , they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall ( Simon , Kaufmann , Müsch , Kischkel , & Kathmann , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," 4273 . SPECIFIC PHOBIAPhobia is a Greek word that means fear .","0"
psychology," A person diagnosed with a specific phobia ( formerly known as simple phobia ) experiences excessive , distressing , and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation ( such as animals , enclosed spaces , elevators , or flying ) ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," Even though people realize their level of fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational , some people with a specific phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus ( the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety ) .","0"
psychology," 4276 . The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning , such as modeling .","0"
psychology," For example , a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears , even though spiders have never presented any danger to him .","0"
psychology," 4279 . People with panic disorder experience recurrent ( more than one ) and unexpected panic attacks , along with at least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks , worry over the consequences of the attacks , or self - defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks ( e.g. , avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations ) ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder .","0"
psychology," 4282 . Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened ( Bouton , Mineka , & Barlow , 2001 ) .","1"
psychology," For example , consider a child who has asthma .","0"
psychology," 4285 . For centuries , psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective : attributed to a force beyond scientific understanding .","1"
psychology," Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed by spirits ( [ link ] ) ( Maher & Maher , 1985 ) .","0"
psychology," 4288 . The diathesis - stress model ( Zuckerman , 1999 ) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the likelihood of a disorder .","0"
psychology," This diathesis - stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for a disorder ( i.e. , a diathesis ) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse environmental or psychological events ( i.e. , stress ) , such as childhood maltreatment , negative life events , trauma , and so on .","1"
psychology," 4291 . Such feelings would be normal .","0"
psychology," If you felt extremely depressed — so much so that you lost interest in activities , had difficulty eating or sleeping , felt utterly worthless , and contemplated suicide — your feelings would be atypical , would deviate from the norm , and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder .","0"
psychology," Just because something is atypical , however , does not necessarily mean it is disordered .","0"
psychology," 4294 . Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .","0"
psychology," According to the APA ( 2013 ) , a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following :","0"
psychology," 4297 . The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity ; the co - occurrence of two disorders .","1"
psychology," For example , the DSM-5 mentions that 41 % of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4300 . Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists ( [ link ] ) who focused on temperament , the inborn , genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter .","0"
psychology," They believed personality is largely governed by biology .","0"
psychology," 4303 . The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .","0"
psychology," The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .","1"
psychology," Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .","0"
psychology," 4306 . Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing .","0"
psychology," This kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud — projection — as a way to assess unconscious processes .","1"
psychology," 4309 . A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank ( RISB ) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950 ( recall his theory of locus of control , covered earlier in this chapter ) .","0"
psychology," There are three forms of this test for use with different age groups : the school form , the college form , and the adult form .","0"
psychology," 3312 . This is precisely the situation that Charles Darwin describes in the theory of evolution by natural selection ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," In simple terms , the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce , while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off .","1"
psychology," 3315 . During the egg 's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes .","0"
psychology," Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .","1"
psychology," DNA is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs .","1"
psychology," 3318 . Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) .","1"
psychology," A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .","1"
psychology," Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," ( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .","1"
psychology," 3327 . So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene .","0"
psychology," Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .","1"
psychology," Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .","0"
psychology," 3330 . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction .","0"
psychology," Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall .","1"
psychology," For example , if an individual ’s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation .","0"
psychology," 3333 . As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious .","0"
psychology," For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non - twin siblings ) .","1"
psychology," But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’s life .","0"
psychology," 3336 . In a study of people who were given up for adoption , adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study :","0"
psychology," 3339 . Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .","1"
psychology," Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .","1"
psychology," This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons .","0"
psychology," 3342 . The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .","1"
psychology," The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .","0"
psychology," 3345 . These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .","0"
psychology," The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .","1"
psychology," 3348 . Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .","0"
psychology," Receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach , vary in shape , with different shapes “ matching ” different neurotransmitters .","1"
psychology," 3351 . Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential .","1"
psychology," Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) .","0"
psychology," 3354 . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals .","1"
psychology," The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions .","0"
psychology," 3357 . The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) .","0"
psychology," Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake .","0"
psychology," Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3360 . In this perspective , psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders .","0"
psychology," Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance .","1"
psychology," Acetylcholine is involved in muscle action and memory ; it can increase arousal and enhance cognition .","0"
psychology," 3363 . The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions : the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , shown in [ link ] .","0"
psychology," The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord ; the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body .","1"
psychology," 3366 . It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress - related activities ; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine , day - to - day operations .","1"
psychology," The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .","0"
psychology," 3369 . For example , think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people , or right before taking a big test .","0"
psychology," You are in no real physical danger in those situations , and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response .","0"
psychology," This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world ; in fact , we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee .","0"
psychology," 3372 . These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .","0"
psychology," The most prominent sulcus , known as the longitudinal fissure , is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres : the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere .","1"
psychology," 3375 . Forebrain StructuresThe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain ( [ link ] ) , which is the largest part of the brain .","0"
psychology," The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex ( called subcortical structures ) : thalamus , hypothalamus , pituitary gland , and the limbic system ( collection of structures ) .","1"
psychology," 3378 . Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas Gage .","0"
psychology," On September 13 , 1848 , Gage ( age 25 ) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont .","0"
psychology," 3381 . The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .","1"
psychology," It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .","1"
psychology," The somatosensory cortex is organized topographically , which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3384 . The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .","1"
psychology," Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .","1"
psychology," Whereas individuals with damage to Broca ’s area have difficulty producing language , those with damage to Wernicke ’s area can produce sensible language , but they are unable to understand it ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3387 . Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .","0"
psychology," The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .","1"
psychology," All of our senses , with the exception of smell , are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3390 . The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .","1"
psychology," The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .","1"
psychology," The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .","1"
psychology," 3393 . Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .","1"
psychology," The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .","1"
psychology," 3396 . The hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord .","1"
psychology," It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3399 . The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) receives messages from muscles , tendons , joints , and structures in our ear to control balance , coordination , movement , and motor skills .","1"
psychology," The cerebellum is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories .","0"
psychology," 3402 . A computerized tomography ( CT ) scan involves taking a number of x - rays of a particular section of a person ’s body or brain ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," The x - rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates , allowing a computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned .","0"
psychology," 3405 . Tissues of different densities give off different signals , which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor .","0"
psychology," Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) operates on the same principles , but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels .","1"
psychology," The fMRI provides more detailed images of the brain ’s structure , as well as better accuracy in time , than is possible in PET scans ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3408 . Major GlandsThe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it .","1"
psychology," The pituitary is often referred to as the “ master gland ” because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus .","0"
psychology," 3411 . The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .","1"
psychology," The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .","1"
psychology," These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .","0"
psychology," 3414 . For one , each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment .","0"
psychology," An informed consent form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment , including potential risks and implications of the research .","1"
psychology," It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time .","0"
psychology," 3417 . A participant in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study receives an injection .","0"
psychology," "" >","0"
psychology," 3420 . Correlation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables ( such as ice cream consumption and crime ) , but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect .","1"
psychology," When two variables are correlated , it simply means that as one variable changes , so does the other .","1"
psychology," 3423 . Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .","0"
psychology," A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions .","1"
psychology," If two variables are negatively correlated , a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa .","0"
psychology," 3426 . Think back to our discussion of the research done by the American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer .","0"
psychology," It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer , but if we were limited to correlational research , we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption .","0"
psychology," 3429 . As you ’ve learned , the only way to establish that there is a cause - and - effect relationship between two variables is to conduct a scientific experiment .","0"
psychology," Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life .","0"
psychology," 3432 . We also need to precisely define , or operationalize , what is considered violent and nonviolent .","0"
psychology," An operational definition is a description of how we will measure our variables , and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment .","1"
psychology," In operationalizing violent behavior , we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior , or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges .","0"
psychology," 3435 . In a double - blind study , both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments .","1"
psychology," Why would a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group ?","0"
psychology," 3438 . In our example of how violent television programs affect children ’s display of violent behavior , the independent variable is the type of program — violent or nonviolent — viewed by participants in the study ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," A dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had .","1"
psychology," In our example , the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants .","0"
psychology," 3441 . Now that we have a sample , the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment .","0"
psychology," With random assignment , all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group .","1"
psychology," There is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group .","0"
psychology," 3444 . The American Psychological Association ( APA ) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for submission to scientific journals .","0"
psychology," Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology Today , which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology , scientific journals generally publish peer - reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves .","1"
psychology," 3447 . This is where validity comes into play .","0"
psychology," Validity refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it ’s supposed to measure .","1"
psychology," While any valid measure is by necessity reliable , the reverse is not necessarily true .","0"
psychology," 3450 . We want our researcher to be inconspicuous — perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information .","0"
psychology," This type of observational study is called naturalistic observation : observing behavior in its natural setting .","1"
psychology," To better understand peer exclusion , Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground .","0"
psychology," 3453 . Another potential problem in observational research is observer bias .","0"
psychology," Generally , people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations .","1"
psychology," 3456 . Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research methods .","0"
psychology," A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population , which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in .","1"
psychology," Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population .","0"
psychology," 3459 . Another approach is cross - sectional research .","0"
psychology," In cross - sectional research , a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time .","1"
psychology," Using the dietary habits example above , the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age .","0"
psychology," 3462 . One of your responsibilities is to manage the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents ’ tax dollars .","0"
psychology," As the new governor , you need to decide whether to continue funding the D.A.R.E .","0"
psychology," ( Drug Abuse Resistance Education ) program in public schools ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," This program typically involves police officers coming into the classroom to educate students about the dangers of becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs .","1"
psychology," 3465 . The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive .","0"
psychology," In deductive reasoning , ideas are tested against the empirical world ; in inductive reasoning , empirical observations lead to new ideas ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," These processes are inseparable , like inhaling and exhaling , but different research approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects .","0"
psychology," 3468 . A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .","0"
psychology," Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3471 . The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .","0"
psychology," The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind .","1"
psychology," Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge .","0"
psychology," 3474 . Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .","0"
psychology," A dissertation is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate ’s doctoral training .","1"
psychology," In the United States , a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3477 . Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in the preceding section .","0"
psychology," Reflective of the discipline ’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American Psychological Association ( APA ) .","0"
psychology," The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the United States .","1"
psychology," 3480 . Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," As such , sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary .","0"
psychology," 3483 . Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood , providing enormous insight into the differences in physical , cognitive , and social capacities that exist between very young children and adults .","0"
psychology," For instance , research by Jean Piaget ( [ link ] ) demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object permanence .","0"
psychology," Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist , even if they are hidden from us .","1"
psychology," 3486 . Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .","1"
psychology," These five dimensions are known as the “ Big Five ” or the Five Factor model , and include dimensions of conscientiousness , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness , and extraversion ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan ( e.g. , Rantanen , Metsäpelto , Feldt , Pulkinnen , and Kokko , 2007 ; Soldz & Vaillant , 1999 ; McCrae & Costa , 2008 ) and is influenced by genetics ( e.g. , Jang , Livesly , and Vernon , 1996 ) .","0"
psychology," 3489 . Industrial - Organizational psychology ( I - O psychology ) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological theories , principles , and research findings in industrial and organizational settings .","1"
psychology," I - O psychologists are often involved in issues related to personnel management , organizational structure , and workplace environment .","0"
psychology," 3492 . Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance , including motivation and performance anxiety , and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing .","1"
psychology," Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general .","0"
psychology," 3495 . As mentioned earlier , both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy .","0"
psychology," While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still found among some of today ’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective , Roger ’s ideas about client - centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate .","0"
psychology," Furthermore , both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of behavioral therapy , cognitive therapy , and cognitive - behavioral therapy ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3498 . Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience .","0"
psychology," Wundt used introspection ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed .","1"
psychology," Wundt ’s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable ( repeatable ) experience of the mind ( Danziger , 1980 ) .","0"
psychology," 3501 . Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected .","1"
psychology," As James saw it , psychology ’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as functionalism .","0"
psychology," Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment .","1"
psychology," 3504 . These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles .","0"
psychology," The word Gestalt roughly translates to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception .","1"
psychology," For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony .","0"
psychology," 3507 . Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible , Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control .","1"
psychology," Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism .","0"
psychology," A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism .","0"
psychology," 3510 . Thus , humanism emerged .","0"
psychology," Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans .","1"
psychology," Two of the most well - known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers ( O’Hara , n.d . ) .","0"
psychology," 3513 . Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under - studied .","0"
psychology," There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) .","0"
psychology," 3516 . Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .","1"
psychology," Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .","1"
psychology," In between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming , intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use , meditative states , hypnotic states , and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation .","0"
psychology," 3519 . If we have biological rhythms , then is there some sort of biological clock ?","0"
psychology," In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .","1"
psychology," 3522 . For example , most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day .","0"
psychology," One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .","0"
psychology," The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .","1"
psychology," 3525 . When we do this , we often experience jet lag .","0"
psychology," Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .","1"
psychology," These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .","1"
psychology," 3528 . When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day - to - day life , they accumulate a sleep debt .","0"
psychology," A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis .","0"
psychology," The consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency .","0"
psychology," 3531 . One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology .","0"
psychology," Evolutionary psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of natural selection .","1"
psychology," Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring .","0"
psychology," 3534 . The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep .","0"
psychology," Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep , the period during which we drift off to sleep .","1"
psychology," During this time , there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat .","0"
psychology," 3537 . As we move into stage 2 sleep , the body goes into a state of deep relaxation .","1"
psychology," Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3540 . Stage 3 and stage 4 of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow - wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency ( up to 4 Hz ) , high amplitude delta waves ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," During this time , an individual ’s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically .","0"
psychology," 3543 . Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .","1"
psychology," Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .","1"
psychology," For instance , if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake , Freud might have argued that this represents the woman ’s fear of sexual intimacy , with the snake serving as a symbol of a man ’s penis .","0"
psychology," 3546 . Some forms of psychotherapy , such as cognitive - behavioral therapy , can help sufferers of insomnia .","0"
psychology," Cognitive - behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors .","1"
psychology," The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia ( e.g. , spending more waking time in bed ) .","0"
psychology," 3549 . REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phase does not occur .","1"
psychology," Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep , especially during disturbing dreams .","0"
psychology," 3552 . Sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper ’s breathing stops .","1"
psychology," These episodes can last 10–20 seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal .","0"
psychology," 3555 . In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005 ) .","1"
psychology," One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .","0"
psychology," A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .","1"
psychology," Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose .","0"
psychology," 3558 . Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .","1"
psychology," These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .","1"
psychology," This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep ( Burgess & Scammell , 2012 ; Hishikawa & Shimizu , 1995 ; Luppi et al . , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," 3561 . In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .","1"
psychology," In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .","1"
psychology," Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .","1"
psychology," 3564 . Ethanol , which we commonly refer to as alcohol , is in a class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," A depressant is a drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity .","1"
psychology," Other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines .","0"
psychology," 3567 . The cocaine , amphetamine , cathinones , and MDMA users seek a euphoric high , feelings of intense elation and pleasure , especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking .","0"
psychology," Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences .","0"
psychology," 3570 . An opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin , morphine , methadone , and codeine .","1"
psychology," Opioids have analgesic properties ; that is , they decrease pain .","0"
psychology," 3573 . Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .","1"
psychology," Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .","1"
psychology," Other drugs , including the opioid buprenorphine , have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal .","0"
psychology," 3576 . Hypnosis is a state of extreme self - focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli .","1"
psychology," In the therapeutic setting , a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient .","0"
psychology," 3579 . These cells relay messages , in the form of action potentials ( as you learned when studying biopsychology ) , to the central nervous system .","0"
psychology," The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction .","1"
psychology," 3582 . Sometimes , we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them .","1"
psychology," This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd ) or difference threshold .","0"
psychology," Unlike the absolute threshold , the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity .","0"
psychology," 3585 . On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .","1"
psychology," This is called top - down processing .","0"
psychology," 3588 . If so , then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise .","0"
psychology," The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory .","1"
psychology," This might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep .","0"
psychology," 3591 . Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .","1"
psychology," Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .","1"
psychology," 3594 . The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see .","1"
psychology," As [ link ] shows , the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays , x - rays , ultraviolet light , visible light , infrared light , microwaves , and radio waves .","0"
psychology," 3597 . This is known as the timbre of a sound .","0"
psychology," Timbre refers to a sound ’s purity , and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency , amplitude , and timing of sound waves .","1"
psychology," 3600 . It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .","0"
psychology," The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes , and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal .","1"
psychology," When light levels are low , the pupil will become dilated , or expanded , to allow more light to enter the eye .","0"
psychology," 3603 . The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .","0"
psychology," In a normal - sighted individual , the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea , which is part of the retina , the light - sensitive lining of the eye .","1"
psychology," The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3606 . While cones are concentrated in the fovea , where images tend to be focused , rods , another type of photoreceptor , are located throughout the remainder of the retina .","0"
psychology," Rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions , and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones , they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field .","1"
psychology," 3609 . The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm .","1"
psychology," As [ link ] shows , the optic chiasm is an X - shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain .","0"
psychology," 3612 . The trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory — another major theory of color vision is known as the opponent - process theory .","0"
psychology," According to this theory , color is coded in opponent pairs : black - white , yellow - blue , and green - red .","1"
psychology," 3615 . We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth .","0"
psychology," Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .","1"
psychology," One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .","1"
psychology," 3621 . The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .","0"
psychology," The cochlea is a fluid - filled , snail - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3624 . We ’ll discuss two of them here : temporal theory and place theory .","0"
psychology," The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron .","1"
psychology," This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave .","0"
psychology," 3627 . Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .","0"
psychology," Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both monaural ( one - eared ) and binaural ( two - eared ) cues to localize sound .","1"
psychology," 3630 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .","1"
psychology," Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .","1"
psychology," 3633 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .","1"
psychology," One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .","0"
psychology," 3636 . This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .","0"
psychology," Cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone , a speech processor , and an electrode array .","1"
psychology," The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain .","0"
psychology," 3639 . You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste : sweet , salty , sour , and bitter .","0"
psychology," Research demonstrates , however , that we have at least six taste groupings .","0"
psychology," Umami is our fifth taste .","0"
psychology," 3642 . Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose .","1"
psychology," Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3645 . These receptors include Meissner ’s corpuscles , Pacinian corpuscles , Merkel ’s disks , and Ruffini corpuscles .","0"
psychology," Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .","1"
psychology," Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .","0"
psychology," 3648 . Generally speaking , pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature .","0"
psychology," Pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain .","1"
psychology," In some situations , pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system .","0"
psychology," 3651 . The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture .","1"
psychology," As [ link ] shows , the major sensory organs ( utricle , saccule , and the three semicircular canals ) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear .","0"
psychology," 3654 . One Gestalt principle is the figure - ground relationship .","0"
psychology," According to this principle , we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground .","1"
psychology," 3657 . Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity ( or good continuation ) and closure .","0"
psychology," The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3660 . You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .","0"
psychology," Our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses : educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information .","1"
psychology," These hypotheses are informed by a number of factors , including our personalities , experiences , and expectations .","0"
psychology," 3663 . Both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with .","0"
psychology," Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment .","1"
psychology," They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .","0"
psychology," 3666 . Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence .","0"
psychology," Associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment .","1"
psychology," You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes , both conscious and unconscious .","0"
psychology," 3669 . Pavlov ( 1849 – 1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events .","1"
psychology," Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .","0"
psychology," "" >","0"
psychology," 3672 . Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a bell ) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The tone was the neutral stimulus ( NS ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response .","1"
psychology," Prior to conditioning , the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs .","0"
psychology," 3675 . Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the “ squeak ” of the cabinet .","0"
psychology," Pairing a new neutral stimulus ( “ squeak ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ zzhzhz ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning .","1"
psychology," This means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus : the squeaky cabinet ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3678 . Soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone .","0"
psychology," Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus .","1"
psychology," When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the dog , cat , or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response , and finally no response .","0"
psychology," 3681 . On the other hand , when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination .","1"
psychology," The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response .","0"
psychology," 3687 . His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .","0"
psychology," According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .","1"
psychology," Essentially , if an organism does something that brings about a desired result , the organism is more likely to do it again .","0"
psychology," 3690 . Remember that reinforcement , even when it is negative , always increases a behavior .","0"
psychology," In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .","1"
psychology," In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .","1"
psychology," 3693 . ShapingIn his operant conditioning experiments , Skinner often used an approach called shaping .","0"
psychology," Instead of rewarding only the target behavior , in shaping , we reward successive approximations of a target behavior .","1"
psychology," Why is shaping needed ?","0"
psychology," 3699 . With a variable interval reinforcement schedule , the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time , which are unpredictable .","1"
psychology," Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast - food restaurant .","0"
psychology," 3702 . Although strict behaviorists such as Skinner and Watson refused to believe that cognition ( such as thoughts and expectations ) plays a role in learning , another behaviorist , Edward C. Tolman , had a different opinion .","0"
psychology," Tolman ’s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement ( Tolman & Honzik , 1930 ; Tolman , Ritchie , & Kalish , 1946 ) .","0"
psychology," 3705 . Previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning , which are forms of associative learning .","0"
psychology," In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .","1"
psychology," The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .","1"
psychology," 3708 . Bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory , which took cognitive processes into account .","0"
psychology," According to Bandura , pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement .","0"
psychology," He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation .","0"
psychology," 3711 . What are the implications of this study ?","0"
psychology," Bandura concluded that we watch and learn , and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects .","0"
psychology," Prosocial ( positive ) models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior .","0"
psychology," 3714 . The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts .","0"
psychology," Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .","1"
psychology," Concepts are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by observing details , and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .","0"
psychology," 3717 . An artificial concept , on the other hand , is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics .","1"
psychology," Various properties of geometric shapes , like squares and triangles , serve as useful examples of artificial concepts .","0"
psychology," 3723 . Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .","1"
psychology," Grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon ( Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," For instance , English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “ -ed ” at the end to indicate past tense .","0"
psychology," 3726 . Semantics and syntax are part of a language ’s grammar .","0"
psychology," Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .","1"
psychology," Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," 3729 . B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .","0"
psychology," Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .","0"
psychology," The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds .","0"
psychology," 3732 . Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," For example , a well - known strategy is trial and error .","0"
psychology," The old adage , “ If at first you do n’t succeed , try , try again ” describes trial and error .","0"
psychology," 3738 . The realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias .","0"
psychology," An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .","1"
psychology," In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point .","0"
psychology," The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .","1"
psychology," 3741 . Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .","1"
psychology," In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .","0"
psychology," Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .","1"
psychology," 3744 . Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .","1"
psychology," In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring , while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others .","1"
psychology," 3747 . According to the drive theory of motivation , deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs .","1"
psychology," These needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and , ultimately , bring the system back to homeostasis .","0"
psychology," 3750 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .","1"
psychology," Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .","0"
psychology," 3753 . In the 1940s , Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components : crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence ( Cattell , 1963 ) .","0"
psychology," Crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it .","1"
psychology," When you learn , remember , and recall information , you are using crystallized intelligence .","0"
psychology," 3756 . Practical intelligence , as proposed by Sternberg , is sometimes compared to “ street smarts . ”","0"
psychology," Being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences .","1"
psychology," This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ ; individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence ( Sternberg , 1988 ) .","0"
psychology," 3759 . Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner , a Harvard psychologist and former student of Erik Erikson .","0"
psychology," Gardner ’s theory , which has been refined for more than 30 years , is a more recent development among theories of intelligence .","0"
psychology," 3762 . Creativity is the ability to generate , create , or discover new ideas , solutions , and possibilities .","1"
psychology," Very creative people often have intense knowledge about something , work on it for years , look at novel solutions , seek out the advice and help of other experts , and take risks .","0"
psychology," 3765 . For most people , once they have eaten , they feel satiation , or fullness and satisfaction , and their eating behavior stops .","0"
psychology," Like the initiation of eating , satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms .","0"
psychology," 3768 . Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity , but our body ’s metabolic rate also comes into play .","0"
psychology," A person ’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time , and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates .","1"
psychology," People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism .","0"
psychology," 3771 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .","1"
psychology," People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .","1"
psychology," 3774 . Prader - Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism .","1"
psychology," Typically , affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating .","0"
psychology," 3777 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .","1"
psychology," Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .","0"
psychology," 3780 . Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual ’s sexual orientation ( Jenkins , 2010 ) .","1"
psychology," Sexual orientation is an individual ’s emotional and erotic attractions to same - sexed individuals ( homosexual ) , opposite - sexed individuals ( heterosexual ) , or both ( bisexual ) .","1"
psychology," 3783 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .","1"
psychology," During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .","1"
psychology," 3786 . In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .","0"
psychology," Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation .","1"
psychology," While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .","0"
psychology," 3789 . When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex , then they experience gender dysphoria .","0"
psychology," Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are .","1"
psychology," This dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria .","0"
psychology," 3792 . As a result , the test was normed and standardized , which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve ( bell curves will be discussed later ) .","0"
psychology," Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .","1"
psychology," Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .","1"
psychology," 3795 . Without a large sample size , it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population .","0"
psychology," A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately represents the general population .","1"
psychology," If , for example , you measured the height of the women in your classroom only , you might not actually have a representative sample .","0"
psychology," 3807 . The Schachter - Singer two - factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience .","0"
psychology," According to this theory , emotions are composed of two factors : physiological and cognitive .","1"
psychology," 3810 . THE BIOLOGY OF EMOTIONS","0"
psychology," Earlier , you learned about the limbic system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," The limbic system includes the hypothalamus , thalamus , amygdala , and the hippocampus .","0"
psychology," 3813 . It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .","0"
psychology," The central nucleus plays a role in attention , and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems ’ activity ( Pessoa , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," 3816 . This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions is universal , and indeed , this idea was suggested in the late 19th century in Charles Darwin ’s book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .","0"
psychology," In fact , there is substantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions .","0"
psychology," These include : happiness , surprise , sadness , fright , disgust , contempt , and anger ( [ link ] ) ( Ekman & Keltner , 1997 ) .","0"
psychology," 3819 . Personality refers to the long - standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think , feel , and behave in specific ways .","1"
psychology," Our personality is what makes us unique individuals .","0"
psychology," 3822 . According to Freud , unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression , along with childhood sexuality , are the forces that influence our personality .","0"
psychology," Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality .","1"
psychology," These theorists , referred to as neo - Freudians , generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter , but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality .","0"
psychology," 3825 . The unconscious i d contains our most primitive drives or urges , and is present from birth .","1"
psychology," It directs impulses for hunger , thirst , and sex .","0"
psychology," 3828 . According to Freud , a person who has a strong ego , which can balance the demands of the i d and the superego , has a healthy personality .","0"
psychology," Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis ( a tendency to experience negative emotions ) , anxiety disorders , or unhealthy behaviors .","1"
psychology," For example , a person who is dominated by their i d might be narcissistic and impulsive .","0"
psychology," 3834 . In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .","1"
psychology," Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .","0"
psychology," 3837 . After passing through the oral stage , children enter what Freud termed the anal stage ( 1–3 years ) .","0"
psychology," In this stage , children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements , so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training .","1"
psychology," 3840 . The final stage is the genital stage ( from puberty on ) .","0"
psychology," In this stage , there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface .","1"
psychology," 3843 . He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .","1"
psychology," Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .","0"
psychology," An inferiority complex refers to a person ’s feelings that they lack worth and do n’t measure up to the standards of others or of society .","1"
psychology," 3846 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) . These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .","1"
psychology," 3849 . Memory is an information processing system ; therefore , we often compare it to a computer .","0"
psychology," Memory is the set of processes used to encode , store , and retrieve information over different periods of time ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system .","1"
psychology," Storage is the retention of the encoded information .","1"
psychology," 3852 . It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information .","1"
psychology," This is known as effortful processing ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3855 . Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding , especially if we apply what is called the self - reference effect .","0"
psychology," The self - reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance ( Rogers , Kuiper & Kirker , 1977 ) .","1"
psychology," Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter ?","0"
psychology," 3858 . In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .","0"
psychology," These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .","0"
psychology," Their model of human memory ( [ link ] ) , called Atkinson - Shiffrin ( A - S ) , is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information .","1"
psychology," 3861 . Short - term memory ( STM ) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory ; sometimes it is called working memory .","1"
psychology," Short - term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long - term memory .","0"
psychology," 3864 . Understanding the different types is important because a person ’s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of LTM intact while having disastrous consequences for other types .","0"
psychology," Explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall .","1"
psychology," For example , if you are studying for your chemistry exam , the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory .","0"
psychology," 3867 . Declarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced .","1"
psychology," Explicit ( declarative ) memory has two parts : semantic memory and episodic memory .","0"
psychology," 3870 . Can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life — meals , conversations , clothing choices , weather conditions , and so on ?","0"
psychology," Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions ; however , American actress Marilu Henner , best known for the television show Taxi , can remember .","0"
psychology," She has an amazing and highly superior autobiographical memory ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3873 . There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long - term memory storage system : recall , recognition , and relearning .","0"
psychology," Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval : it means you can access information without cues .","1"
psychology," For example , you would use recall for an essay test .","0"
psychology," 3876 . Karl Lashley began exploring this problem , about 100 years ago , by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys .","0"
psychology," He was searching for evidence of the engram : the group of neurons that serve as the “ physical representation of memory ” ( Josselyn , 2010 ) .","1"
psychology," First , Lashley ( 1950 ) trained rats to find their way through a maze .","0"
psychology," 3879 . Another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats , and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks , such as object recognition and maze running .","0"
psychology," 3882 . It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories , and weaker emotional experiences form weaker memories ; this is called arousal theory ( Christianson , 1992 ) .","1"
psychology," For example , strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters , as well as hormones , which strengthen memory ; therefore , our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non - emotional event .","0"
psychology," 3885 . Albert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning .","0"
psychology," He disagreed , however , with Skinner ’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning .","0"
psychology," 3888 . Bandura ( 1977 , 1995 ) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development , and most recently has focused on the concept of self - efficacy .","0"
psychology," Self - efficacy is our level of confidence in our own abilities , developed through our social experiences .","1"
psychology," Self - efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals .","0"
psychology," 3891 . Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford , where he was a colleague of Albert Bandura .","0"
psychology," Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait prediction of behavior , and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology .","0"
psychology," 3894 . Retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma .","1"
psychology," People with retrograde amnesia can not remember some or even all of their past .","0"
psychology," 3897 . In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes , the Innocence Project discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions ( Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Yeshiva University , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," "" >","0"
psychology," 3900 . Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome .","1"
psychology," This syndrome has received a lot of publicity , particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses — often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim ( e.g. , sexual abuse ) .","0"
psychology," 3903 . I know I read the book in high school , and I remember that one of the main characters is named Scout , and her father is an attorney , but I honestly do n’t remember anything else . ”","0"
psychology," Nathan wonders if his mother actually read the book , and his mother is surprised she ca n’t recall the plot .","0"
psychology," What is going on here is storage decay : unused information tends to fade with the passage of time .","1"
psychology," In 1885 , German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization .","0"
psychology," First , he memorized lists of nonsense syllables .","0"
psychology," 3906 . Memories can also be affected by bias , which is the final distortion error .","0"
psychology," Schacter ( 2001 ) says that your feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events .","0"
psychology," 3909 . These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .","0"
psychology," Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .","1"
psychology," For example , this week you are studying about Freud ’s Psychoanalytic Theory .","0"
psychology," 3912 . Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers .","0"
psychology," One of Rogers ’s main ideas about personality regards self - concept , our thoughts and feelings about ourselves .","1"
psychology," How would you respond to the question , “ Who am I ? ” Your answer can show how you see yourself .","0"
psychology," 3915 . According to Rogers ( 1980 ) , “ As persons are accepted and prized , they tend to develop a more caring attitude towards themselves ” ( p. 116 ) .","0"
psychology," Conversely , when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and actual selves , we experience a state Rogers called incongruence , which can lead to maladjustment .","1"
psychology," Both Rogers ’s and Maslow ’s theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is deterministic .","0"
psychology," 3918 . You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36 , 6 x 7 = 42 , and 6 x 8 = 48 .","0"
psychology," Memorizing these facts is rehearsal . Another strategy is chunking : you organize information into manageable bits or chunks ( Bodie , Powers , & Fitch - Hauser , 2006 ) .","1"
psychology," Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers .","0"
psychology," 3921 . Use elaborative rehearsal : In a famous article , Craik and Lockhart ( 1972 ) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long - term memory .","1"
psychology," Their theory is called levels of processing .","0"
psychology," If we want to remember a piece of information , we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful .","0"
psychology," 3924 . Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .","1"
psychology," Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .","1"
psychology," We refer to these domains throughout the chapter .","0"
psychology," 3927 . Not all normative events are universal , meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures .","0"
psychology," Biological milestones , such as puberty , tend to be universal , but social milestones , such as the age when children begin formal schooling , are not necessarily universal ; instead , they affect most individuals in a particular culture ( Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ) .","0"
psychology," For example , in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6 years old , but in developing countries , like Nigeria , children often enter school at an advanced age , if at all ( Huebler , 2005 ; United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization [ UNESCO ] , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," 3930 . How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development ?","0"
psychology," Are we who we are because of nature ( biology and genetics ) , or are we who we are because of nurture ( our environment and culture ) ? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate .","1"
psychology," 3933 . Humans are diverse , and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with one another .","0"
psychology," A poignant example is that of Trayvon Martin , a 17 - year - old African American who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer , George Zimmerman , in a predominantly White neighborhood in 2012 .","0"
psychology," Zimmerman grew suspicious of the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin .","0"
psychology," 3936 . Erik Erikson ( 1902 – 1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .","0"
psychology," Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .","0"
psychology," 3939 . Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world .","0"
psychology," Schemata are concepts ( mental models ) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information .","1"
psychology," By the time children have reached adulthood , they have created schemata for almost everything .","0"
psychology," 3942 . The first stage is the sensorimotor stage , which lasts from birth to about 2 years old .","1"
psychology," During this stage , children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior .","0"
psychology," 3945 . Kenny ’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces , so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did .","0"
psychology," Children in this stage can not perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something , it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added .","1"
psychology," 3948 . Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility , which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition .","1"
psychology," Take , for example , water that you poured into the short , fat glass : You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount ( minus a couple of drops ) .","0"
psychology," 3951 . After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas , Kohlberg reviewed people ’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," According to Kohlberg , an individual progresses from the capacity for pre - conventional morality ( before age 9 ) to the capacity for conventional morality ( early adolescence ) , and toward attaining post - conventional morality ( once formal operational thought is attained ) , which only a few fully achieve .","0"
psychology," 3954 . Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .","1"
psychology," Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .","1"
psychology," 3957 . In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .","1"
psychology," An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .","1"
psychology," Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective .","0"
psychology," 3960 . Therefore , a person ’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior .","0"
psychology," In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( [ link ] ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001 ) .","1"
psychology," People from collectivistic cultures , such as some Asian cultures , are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual .","0"
psychology," Activities such as ( a ) preparing a meal , ( b ) hanging out , and ( c ) playing a game engage people in a group .","0"
psychology," 3963 . We can understand self - serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution , a belief about the cause of a result .","1"
psychology," One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions : locus of control ( internal versus external ) , stability ( stable versus unstable ) , and controllability ( controllable versus uncontrollable ) .","0"
psychology," 3966 . A mother and father ’s DNA is passed on to the child at the moment of conception .","0"
psychology," Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .","0"
psychology," 3969 . After the zygote divides for about 7–10 days and has 150 cells , it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus .","1"
psychology," Upon implantation , this multi - cellular organism is called an embryo .","0"
psychology," Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .","0"
psychology," 3972 . A teratogen is any environmental agent — biological , chemical , or physical — that causes damage to the developing embryo or fetus .","1"
psychology," There are different types of teratogens .","0"
psychology," 3975 . Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .","1"
psychology," Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .","1"
psychology," 3978 . In social and emotional development , forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy .","0"
psychology," Attachment is a long - standing connection or bond with others .","1"
psychology," Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone .","0"
psychology," 3981 . With avoidant attachment , the child is unresponsive to the parent , does not use the parent as a secure base , and does not care if the parent leaves .","1"
psychology," The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger .","0"
psychology," 3984 . Baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles : authoritative , authoritarian , permissive , and uninvolved .","0"
psychology," With the authoritative style , the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits , expresses warmth and affection , and listens to the child ’s point of view .","1"
psychology," Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them .","0"
psychology," 3987 . With the uninvolved style of parenting , the parents are indifferent , uninvolved , and sometimes referred to as neglectful .","1"
psychology," They do n’t respond to the child ’s needs and make relatively few demands .","0"
psychology," 3990 . While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable , the onset and pace of puberty vary widely .","0"
psychology," Several physical changes occur during puberty , such as adrenarche and gonadarche , the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands , respectively .","0"
psychology," Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .","0"
psychology," 3993 . Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .","1"
psychology," Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12 – 13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13 – 14 years old .","1"
psychology," 3996 . Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support .","0"
psychology," As we get older , socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number , but remain as close , if not more close than in our earlier years ( Carstensen , 1992 ) ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3999 . This shared knowledge comes from social norms .","0"
psychology," A social norm is a group ’s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are supposed to behave and think ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ; Berkowitz , 2004 ) .","1"
psychology," How are we expected to act ?","0"
psychology," 4002 . ZIMBARDO ’S STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT","0"
psychology," The famous Stanford prison experiment , conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues at Stanford University , demonstrated the power of social roles , social norms , and scripts .","0"
psychology," In the summer of 1971 , an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life .","0"
psychology," 4005 . Now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs .","0"
psychology," Attitude is our evaluation of a person , an idea , or an object .","1"
psychology," We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies .","0"
psychology," 4008 . The military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to like the group more , due to the justification of effort .","0"
psychology," We do not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave .","0"
psychology," 4011 . The topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology ( Fiske et al . , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," During the Second World War , Carl Hovland extensively researched persuasion for the U.S. Army .","0"
psychology," After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .","0"
psychology," 4014 . The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument ’s worthiness .","0"
psychology," For example , a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car ’s safety features and fuel economy .","0"
psychology," 4017 . Solomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people .","0"
psychology," In one study , a group of participants was shown a series of printed line segments of different lengths : a , b , and c ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4020 . The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual ’s judgment .","1"
psychology," What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure ?","0"
psychology," Research shows that the size of the majority , the presence of another dissenter , and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key influences on conformity .","0"
psychology," 4023 . In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .","1"
psychology," However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .","1"
psychology," What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ?","0"
psychology," 4026 . Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience .","0"
psychology," When certain features of the situation were changed , participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks ( Milgram , 1965 ) .","0"
psychology," 4029 . Sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance .","0"
psychology," Social facilitation occurs when an individual performs better when an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone .","1"
psychology," This typically occurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled .","0"
psychology," 4032 . The field of I - O psychology can be divided into three broad areas ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) : industrial , organizational , and human factors .","0"
psychology," Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their ability to meet those requirements .","1"
psychology," In addition , once employees are hired , industrial psychology studies and develops ways to train , evaluate , and respond to those evaluations .","0"
psychology," 4035 . Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising , management , and personnel selection .","0"
psychology," In 1903 , Scott published two books : The Theory of Advertising and Psychology of Advertising .","0"
psychology," 4038 . Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology , the field of human factors psychology was also developing .","0"
psychology," Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers .","0"
psychology," In 1911 he put forward his theory in a book titled , The Principles of Scientific Management ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4041 . These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different .","0"
psychology," Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) .","1"
psychology," Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group .","0"
psychology," 4044 . Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a specific racial group ( such as toward African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinos , Native Americans , European Americans ) .","1"
psychology," What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups ?","0"
psychology," 4047 . Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .","1"
psychology," Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," 4050 . When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .","0"
psychology," A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .","1"
psychology," 4053 . These groups serve as our in - groups .","0"
psychology," An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .","1"
psychology," A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .","1"
psychology," 4056 . This often happens by blaming an out - group for the problem .","0"
psychology," Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out - group when the in - group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal ( Allport , 1954 ) .","1"
psychology," 4059 . Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .","1"
psychology," In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .","1"
psychology," 4062 . Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of bullying ( APA , 2010 ) , researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being bullied ( Olweus , 1993 ) :","0"
psychology," 4065 . Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect .","0"
psychology," The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress .","1"
psychology," Instead , they just watch what is happening .","0"
psychology," 4068 . Research suggests there are many other reasons .","0"
psychology," Altruism is people ’s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping .","1"
psychology," In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4071 . Once we form relationships with people , we desire reciprocity .","0"
psychology," Reciprocity is the give and take in relationships .","1"
psychology," We contribute to relationships , but we expect to receive benefits as well .","0"
psychology," 4074 . Sternberg ( 1986 ) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love — intimacy , passion , and commitment — which is described as consummate love ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages .","0"
psychology," 4077 . One theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory .","0"
psychology," According to social exchange theory , we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others ( [ link ] ) ( Rusbult & Van Lange , 2003 ) .","1"
psychology," 4080 . You might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview .","0"
psychology," As you can imagine , most research is concerned with the employer ’s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for the job , a goal that makes sense for the candidate too .","0"
psychology," 4083 . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin : An employer can not discriminate based on skin color , hair texture , or other immutable characteristics , which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity , in hiring , benefits , promotions , or termination of employees .","1"
psychology," The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil Rights Act ; it prohibits job ( e.g. , employment , pay , and termination ) discrimination of a woman because she is pregnant as long as she can perform the work required .","1"
psychology," 4086 . Organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology .","0"
psychology," In organizational psychology , the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization .","1"
psychology," In this section , you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction , different styles of management , different styles of leadership , organizational culture , and teamwork .","0"
psychology," 4089 . Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business ’s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals , and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company ’s employees .","1"
psychology," Industrial - organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing : how the news is delivered to employees ( both those being let go and those staying ) , how laid - off employees are supported ( e.g. , separation packages ) , and how retained employees are supported .","0"
psychology," 4092 . A significant portion of I - O research focuses on management and human relations .","0"
psychology," Douglas McGregor ( 1960 ) combined scientific management ( a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency , especially labor productivity ) and human relations into the notion of leadership behavior .","1"
psychology," His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .","0"
psychology," 4095 . Bass ( 1985 ) popularized and developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles .","0"
psychology," In transactional leadership , the focus is on supervision and organizational goals , which are achieved through a system of rewards and punishments ( i.e. , transactions ) .","1"
psychology," Transactional leaders maintain the status quo : They are managers .","1"
psychology," 4098 . Each company and organization has an organizational culture .","0"
psychology," Organizational culture encompasses the values , visions , hierarchies , norms , and interactions among its employees .","1"
psychology," It is how an organization is run , how it operates , and how it makes decisions — the industry in which the organization participates may have an influence .","0"
psychology," 4101 . The U.S .","0"
psychology," Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( n.d . ) provides the following description of sexual harassment :","0"
psychology," 4104 . Whereas the two other areas of I - O psychology focus on the interface between the worker and team , group , or organization , human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker ’s interaction with a machine , work station , information displays , and the local environment , such as lighting .","1"
psychology," In the United States , human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and engineering ; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth ( psychologist and engineer ) and her husband Frank Gilbreth ( engineer ) .","0"
psychology," 4107 . These conceptualizations are referred to as response - based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions .","0"
psychology," For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” ( Selye , 1976 , p. 74 ) .","1"
psychology," Selye ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it .","0"
psychology," 4110 . Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .","0"
psychology," A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well - being that a stressor might entail .","1"
psychology," A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth .","0"
psychology," 4113 . A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game , meaning he feels fully energized , focused , and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency .","0"
psychology," But when stress exceeds this optimal level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and debilitating , or what Selye termed distress ( from the Latin dis = “ bad ” ) .","1"
psychology," People who reach this level of stress feel burned out ; they are fatigued , exhausted , and their performance begins to decline .","0"
psychology," 4116 . Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action .","0"
psychology," Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight - or - flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) .","1"
psychology," During the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4119 . The general adaptation syndrome , shown in [ link ] , consists of three stages : ( 1 ) alarm reaction , ( 2 ) stage of resistance , and ( 3 ) stage of exhaustion ( Selye , 1936 ; 1976 ) .","0"
psychology," Alarm reaction describes the body ’s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight - or - flight response described by Cannon .","1"
psychology," During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .","0"
psychology," 4122 . What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ?","0"
psychology," The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis .","0"
psychology," When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .","0"
psychology," 4125 . The sociocultural perspective looks at you , your behaviors , and your symptoms in the context of your culture and background .","1"
psychology," For example , José is an 18-year - old Hispanic male from a traditional family .","0"
psychology," 4128 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .","0"
psychology," They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .","0"
psychology," 4131 . Potential stressors do not always involve major life events .","0"
psychology," Daily hassles — the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives ( e.g. , rush hour traffic , lost keys , obnoxious coworkers , inclement weather , arguments with friends or family ) — can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events ( [ link ] ) ( Kanner , Coyne , Schaefer , & Lazarus , 1981 ) .","0"
psychology," 4134 . This helps explain why relapse rates tend to be high .","0"
psychology," About 40 % – 60 % of individuals relapse , which means they return to abusing drugs and/or alcohol after a period of improvement ( National Institute on Drug Abuse [ NIDA ] , 2008 ) .","1"
psychology," 4137 . In this section , we will discuss stress and illness .","0"
psychology," As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky ( 1998 ) describes ,","0"
psychology," 4140 . In addition , the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job .","0"
psychology," This situation is referred to as immunosuppression , the decreased effectiveness of the immune system .","1"
psychology," When people experience immunosuppression , they become susceptible to any number of infections , illness , and diseases .","0"
psychology," 4143 . Shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division , which includes growth and proliferation of new cells , thereby leading to more rapid aging ( Sapolsky , 2004 ) .","0"
psychology," In the study , researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children ( Epel et al. , 2004 ) .","0"
psychology," Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children .","0"
psychology," 4146 . These individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush .","1"
psychology," According to Friedman and Rosenman , these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern ; those who are more relaxed and laid - back were characterized as Type B ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," In a sample of Type As and Type Bs , Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent among the Type As than the Type Bs ( Friedman & Rosenman , 1959 ) .","0"
psychology," 4149 . Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population .","1"
psychology," A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic - depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) .","0"
psychology," 4152 . The therapist informs the client about confidentiality , fees , and what to expect in treatment .","0"
psychology," Confidentiality means the therapist can not disclose confidential communications to any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so .","1"
psychology," During the intake , the therapist and client will work together to discuss treatment goals .","0"
psychology," 4155 . Couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," The couple may be dating , partnered , engaged , or married .","0"
psychology," 4158 . In strategic family therapy , the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in a relatively short amount of time .","1"
psychology," Typically , the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and design a detailed approach to resolving each member ’s problem ( Madanes , 1991 ) .","0"
psychology," 4161 . Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud and was the first form of psychotherapy .","0"
psychology," It was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century , but it has since waned significantly in popularity .","0"
psychology," 4164 . Freud suggested that during this patient - therapist relationship , the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist — maybe positive feelings , maybe negative feelings .","0"
psychology," Freud called this transference : the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient ’s other relationships to the psychoanalyst .","1"
psychology," For example , Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst .","0"
psychology," 4167 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .","1"
psychology," In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .","1"
psychology," 4170 . Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .","0"
psychology," Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior .","1"
psychology," Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors , such as smoking , nail biting , and drinking .","0"
psychology," 4173 . Sometimes , it ’s too impractical , expensive , or embarrassing to re - create anxiety - producing situations , so a therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears .","0"
psychology," Virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking , claustrophobia ( fear of enclosed spaces ) , aviophobia ( fear of flying ) , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a trauma and stressor - related disorder ( Gerardi , Cukor , Difede , Rizzo , & Rothbaum , 2010 ) .","1"
psychology," 4176 . Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s .","0"
psychology," His initial focus was on depression and how a client ’s self - defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life ( Beck , Rush , Shaw , & Emery , 1979 ) ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4179 . Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential .","1"
psychology," So it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self - aware and accepting of themselves .","0"
psychology," In contrast to psychoanalysis , humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts .","0"
psychology," 4182 . In active listening , the therapist acknowledges , restates , and clarifies what the client expresses .","0"
psychology," Therapists also practice what Rogers called unconditional positive regard , which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are .","1"
psychology," Rogers ( 1951 ) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness , empathy , and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves , which results in personal growth .","0"
psychology," 4185 . As we learned in the previous section , stress — especially if it is chronic — takes a toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications .","0"
psychology," When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .","0"
psychology," 4188 . These efforts may include avoiding , minimizing , or distancing oneself from the problem , or positive comparisons with others ( “ I ’m not as bad off as she is ” ) , or seeking something positive in a negative event ( “ Now that I ’ve been fired , I can sleep in for a few days ” ) .","0"
psychology," In some cases , emotion - focused coping strategies involve reappraisal , whereby the stressor is construed differently ( and somewhat self - deceptively ) without changing its objective level of threat ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .","1"
psychology," For example , a person sentenced to federal prison who thinks , “ This will give me a great chance to network with others , ” is using reappraisal .","0"
psychology," 4191 . Building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , sorrow , and fear .","0"
psychology," Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) .","1"
psychology," Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) .","0"
psychology," 4194 . Beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks , there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise ( Salmon , 2001 ) .","0"
psychology," It is well - established that exercise , both of long ( aerobic ) and short ( anaerobic ) duration , is beneficial for both physical and mental health ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .","0"
psychology," 4197 . The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal , and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure ( Benson & Proctor , 1994 ) .","1"
psychology," Another technique to combat stress , biofeedback , was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in the early 1970s .","0"
psychology," Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals .","1"
psychology," 4200 . Measuring happiness and well - being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if people are generally happy or miserable , as well as when and why they might feel the way they do .","0"
psychology," Studies show that average national happiness scores ( over time and across countries ) relate strongly to six key variables : per capita gross domestic product ( GDP , which reflects a nation ’s economic standard of living ) , social support , freedom to make important life choices , healthy life expectancy , freedom from perceived corruption in government and business , and generosity ( Helliwell et al. , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," 4203 . Qualities that help promote psychological well - being ( e.g. , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .","1"
psychology," The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long - lasting , or trait - like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," 4206 . By the 18th century , people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders , but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders .","1"
psychology," Often these people were kept in windowless dungeons , beaten , chained to their beds , and had little to no contact with caregivers .","0"
psychology," 4209 . This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States .","0"
psychology," It started the process of deinstitutionalization , the closing of large asylums , by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally .","1"
psychology," In 1955 , there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patients institutionalized at public hospitals ( Torrey , 1997 ) .","0"
psychology," 4212 . However , there are a group of conditions that , when present , are diagnosed early in childhood , often before the time a child enters school .","0"
psychology," These conditions are listed in the DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders , and they involve developmental problems in personal , social , academic , and intellectual functioning ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," In this section , we will discuss two such disorders : attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and autism .","0"
psychology," 4215 . The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger ’s disorder , generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder ; individuals diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary , but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication , such as talking only about their special interests ( Wing , Gould , & Gillberg , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," However , because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger ’s disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder , the DSM-5 does not include it , which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ( “ Asperger ’s Syndrome Dropped , ” 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder , particularly those with better language and intellectual skills , can live and work independently as adults .","0"
psychology," 4218 . Amnesia refers to the partial or total forgetting of some experience or event .","1"
psychology," An individual with dissociative amnesia is unable to recall important personal information , usually following an extremely stressful or traumatic experience such as combat , natural disasters , or being the victim of violence .","1"
psychology," The memory impairments are not caused by ordinary forgetting .","0"
psychology," 4224 . Schizophrenia is a devastating psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought , perception , emotion , and behavior .","1"
psychology," About 1 % of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime , and usually the disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood ( early to mid-20s ) .","0"
psychology," 4230 . Disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes — usually detected by what a person says .","1"
psychology," The person might ramble , exhibit loose associations ( jump from topic to topic ) , or talk in a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining words .","0"
psychology," 4233 . Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors , emotions , or drives ( Green , 2001 ) .","1"
psychology," A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial expressions , speech , or movements , even when such expressions are normal or expected .","1"
psychology," 4236 . Another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use .","0"
psychology," Although a number of reports have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia ( Thornicroft , 1990 ) , such investigations can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia , or vice versa .","0"
psychology," 4239 . These experiences can include such events as combat , threatened or actual physical attack , sexual assault , natural disasters , terrorist attacks , and automobile accidents .","0"
psychology," This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM in which a cause ( extreme trauma ) is explicitly specified .","0"
psychology," Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event , flashbacks ( states that can last from a few seconds to several days , during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment [ APA , 2013 ] ) , avoidance of stimuli connected to the event , persistently negative emotional states ( e.g. , fear , anger , guilt , and shame ) , feelings of detachment from others , irritability , proneness toward outbursts , and an exaggerated startle response ( jumpiness ) .","1"
psychology," For PTSD to be diagnosed , these symptoms must occur for at least one month .","0"
psychology," 4248 . Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature .","1"
psychology," Mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation .","1"
psychology," 4251 . suicidal ideation : thoughts of death ( not just fear of dying ) , thinking about or planning suicide , or making an actual suicide attempt .","1"
psychology," 4254 . People with persistent depressive disorder ( previously known as dysthymia ) experience depressed moods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years , as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major depressive disorder .","1"
psychology," People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy , but do not meet all the criteria for major depression .","0"
psychology," 4257 . During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .","1"
psychology," The person may talk loudly and rapidly , exhibiting flight of ideas , abruptly switching from one topic to another .","0"
psychology," These individuals are easily distracted , which can make a conversation very difficult .","0"
psychology," 4260 . Another cognitive theory of depression , hopelessness theory , postulates that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness , which then leads to depression ( Abramson , Metalsky , & Alloy , 1989 ) .","1"
psychology," According to this theory , hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur , and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes .","1"
psychology," 4263 . One possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry .","0"
psychology," Contemporary neurological research shows that disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior ( Pompili et al . , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," Low levels of serotonin predict future suicide attempts and suicide completions , and low levels have been observed post - mortem among suicide victims ( Mann , 2003 ) .","0"
psychology," 4269 . Although hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of OCD , considerable evidence suggests that hoarding represents an entirely different disorder ( Mataix - Cols et al . , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," People with hoarding disorder can not bear to part with personal possessions , regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are .","1"
psychology," As a result , these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items that clutter their living areas ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4272 . This woman likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and duration than would a 21-year - old college junior who is having trouble finding a date for the annual social .","0"
psychology," Some people , however , experience anxiety that is excessive , persistent , and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat ; if one ’s anxiety has a disruptive influence on one ’s life , this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety disorder . Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety , and by related disturbances in behavior ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," Although anxiety is universally experienced , anxiety disorders cause considerable distress .","0"
psychology," 4275 . Rachman ( 1977 ) proposed that phobias can be acquired through three major learning pathways .","0"
psychology," The first pathway is through classical conditioning .","0"
psychology," As you may recall , classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response ( UCR ) , eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus .","1"
psychology," 4278 . When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety , they typically perform safety behaviors : mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes .","1"
psychology," Safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact , rehearsing sentences before speaking , talking only briefly , and not talking about oneself ( Alden & Bieling , 1998 ) .","0"
psychology," 4281 . The exact genes and gene functions involved in this disorder , however , are not well - understood ( APA , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," Neurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder .","1"
psychology," Located in the brainstem , the locus coeruleus is the brain ’s major source of norepinephrine , a neurotransmitter that triggers the body ’s fight - or - flight response .","1"
psychology," 4284 . For example , an individual may worry about her health and finances , the health of family members , the safety of her children , or minor matters ( e.g. , being late for an appointment ) without having any legitimate reason for doing so ( APA , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," A diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic of this disorder — what Sigmund Freud referred to as free - floating anxiety — is not part of another disorder , occurs more days than not for at least six months , and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms : restlessness , difficulty concentrating , being easily fatigued , muscle tension , irritability , and sleep difficulties .","1"
psychology," 4287 . Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological disorders have a genetic component ; in fact , there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to genetic factors .","0"
psychology," The graph in [ link ] shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia .","0"
psychology," 4290 . A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .","1"
psychology," Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .","1"
psychology," The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder .","0"
psychology," 4293 . No universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present ( Zachar & Kendler , 2007 ) .","0"
psychology," However , one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield ( 1992 ) , who defined psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction .","0"
psychology," Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms — that is , psychological processes honed by evolution , such as cognition , perception , and learning — have important functions , such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought , problem solving , and communication .","1"

psychology," 4302 . As you have learned in this chapter , personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors .","0"
psychology," The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .","0"
psychology," The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .","1"
psychology," 4305 . One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) , first published in 1943 , with 504 true / false questions , and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989 , with 567 questions .","0"
psychology," The original MMPI was based on a small , limited sample , composed mostly of Minnesota farmers and psychiatric patients ; the revised inventory was based on a more representative , national sample to allow for better standardization .","0"
psychology," 4308 . A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test ( TAT ) , created in the 1930s by Henry Murray , an American psychologist , and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan .","0"
psychology," A person taking the TAT is shown 8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture .","1"
psychology," 4311 . The C - TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African - American lifestyles .","0"
psychology," When the C - TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans , it was found that use of the C - TCB led to increased story length , higher degrees of positive feelings , and stronger identification with the C - TCB ( Hoy , 1997 ; Hoy - Watkins & Jenkins - Moore , 2008 ) .","0"
psychology," The TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to minority groups , especially Hispanic youths .","1"
psychology," TEMAS — standing for “ Tell Me a Story ” but also a play on the Spanish word temas ( themes ) — uses images and storytelling cues that relate to minority culture ( Constantino , 1982 ) .","0"
psychology," 3311 . To explore these questions , let ’s start by focusing on a specific disease , sickle - cell anemia , and how it might affect two infected sisters .","0"
psychology," Sickle - cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells , which are normally round , take on a crescent - like shape ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3314 . Watch this interview with renowned evolutionary psychologist David Buss for an explanation of how a psychologist approaches evolution and how this approach fits within the field of social science .","0"
psychology," 3317 . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles .","0"
psychology," An allele is a specific version of a gene .","1"
psychology," So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has .","0"
psychology," When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes .","0"
psychology," 3320 . Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene .","0"
psychology," A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent .","0"
psychology," In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .","1"
psychology," 3326 . Sickle - cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes .","0"
psychology," For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts .","1"
psychology," If someone with this condition goes untreated , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , seizures , and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders .","0"
psychology," 3329 . Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes .","0"
psychology," A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene .","1"
psychology," While many mutations can be harmful or lethal , once in a while , a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation .","0"
psychology," 3332 . In another approach to gene - environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways .","1"
psychology," In other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes .","0"
psychology," 3335 . Genes affect more than our physical characteristics .","0"
psychology," Indeed , scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics , ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality ( for examples , see Mustanski et al . , 2005 ; Comings , Gonzales , Saucier , Johnson , & MacMurray , 2000 ) .","0"
psychology," 3338 . Glial cells , which outnumber neurons ten to one , are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons , both physically and metabolically .","0"
psychology," Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .","1"
psychology," Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .","0"
psychology," 3341 . Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," A neuron ’s outer surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane .","0"
psychology," This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it , while stopping larger or highly charged molecules .","1"
psychology," 3344 . The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .","0"
psychology," These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .","0"
psychology," The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .","1"
psychology," 3347 . In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs .","1"
psychology," Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .","0"
psychology," 3350 . The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .","0"
psychology," This difference in charge across the membrane , called the membrane potential , provides energy for the signal .","1"
psychology," 3353 . With this influx of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive .","0"
psychology," If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential .","1"
psychology," At the peak of the spike , the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open .","0"
psychology," 3356 . Because it is all or none , the action potential is recreated , or propagated , at its full strength at every point along the axon .","0"
psychology," Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker , it does not fade away as it travels down the axon .","0"
psychology," 3362 . Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .","1"
psychology," An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .","1"
psychology," Agonist and antagonist drugs are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person ’s condition .","0"
psychology," 3365 . The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control .","1"
psychology," It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3368 . His pupils dilate , his heart rate and blood pressure increase , his bladder relaxes , his liver releases glucose , and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream .","1"
psychology," This constellation of physiological changes , known as the fight or flight response , allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety .","0"
psychology," 3371 . When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment , all lower segments are cut off from the brain , causing paralysis .","0"
psychology," Therefore , the lower on the spine damage is , the fewer functions an injured individual loses . The Two HemispheresThe surface of the brain , known as the cerebral cortex , is very uneven , characterized by a distinctive pattern of folds or bumps , known as gyri ( singular : gyrus ) , and grooves , known as sulci ( singular : sulcus ) , shown in [ link ] .","1"
psychology," These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .","0"
psychology," 3374 . The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum , consisting of about 200 million axons .","1"
psychology," The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side .","0"
psychology," Normally , we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day - to - day functions , but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well .","0"
psychology," 3377 . The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .","0"
psychology," It contains the motor cortex , which is involved in planning and coordinating movement ; the prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for higher - level cognitive functioning ; and Broca ’s area , which is essential for language production .","1"
psychology," 3380 . The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .","1"
psychology," It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .","1"
psychology," 3383 . The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .","1"
psychology," The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .","1"
psychology," Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .","0"
psychology," 3386 . Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .","0"
psychology," The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .","1"
psychology," 3389 . The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures , but three of the most important are the hippocampus , the amygdala , and the hypothalamus ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .","1"
psychology," The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .","1"
psychology," 3392 . In 1953 , Henry Gustav Molaison ( H. M. ) was a 27-year - old man who experienced severe seizures .","0"
psychology," In an attempt to control his seizures , H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala .","0"
psychology," 3395 . The substantia nigra ( Latin for “ black substance ” ) and the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are also located in the midbrain ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine , and both are critical for movement .","0"
psychology," 3398 . The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .","1"
psychology," The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .","1"
psychology," It also is involved in regulating brain activity during sleep .","0"
psychology," 3401 . Brain ImagingYou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain .","0"
psychology," Increasingly , however , we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals who have not suffered brain injury .","0"
psychology," In this section , we take a more in - depth look at some of the techniques that are available for imaging the brain , including techniques that rely on radiation , magnetic fields , or electrical activity within the brain .","0"
psychology," 3404 . In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic field .","1"
psychology," The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body ’s cells to move .","0"
psychology," 3407 . The endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Like neurotransmitters , hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal .","1"
psychology," 3410 . The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .","1"
psychology," The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .","1"
psychology," 3413 . Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive , strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm .","0"
psychology," Any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board ( IRB ) .","0"
psychology," The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution ’s administration , scientists , and community members ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," 3416 . For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants ’ responses .","0"
psychology," In cases where deception is involved , participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the study — complete , honest information about the purpose of the experiment , how the data collected will be used , the reasons why deception was necessary , and information about how to obtain additional information about the study .","0"
psychology," 3419 . Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants , animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) .","0"
psychology," An IACUC consists of institutional administrators , scientists , veterinarians , and community members .","1"
psychology," 3422 . The sign — positive or negative — of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction .","1"
psychology," Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .","0"
psychology," 3425 . However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .","0"
psychology," While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .","0"
psychology," In the ice cream / crime rate example mentioned earlier , temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables .","0"
psychology," 3428 . Often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid .","0"
psychology," Or , we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch , ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false ; this is known as confirmation bias .","1"
psychology," Other times , we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind , even if that information is severely limited .","0"
psychology," 3431 . The two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference — experimental manipulation .","0"
psychology," The experimental group gets the experimental manipulation — that is , the treatment or variable being tested ( in this case , violent TV images ) — and the control group does not .","1"
psychology," Since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups , we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance .","0"
psychology," 3434 . By being blind to which child is in which group , we protect against those biases .","0"
psychology," This situation is a single - blind study , meaning that one of the groups ( participants ) are unaware as to which group they are in ( experiment or control group ) while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group .","0"
psychology," 3437 . To achieve this , we must pay attention to two important variables , or things that can be changed , in any experimental study : the independent variable and the dependent variable .","0"
psychology," An independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter .","1"
psychology," In a well - designed experimental study , the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups .","0"
psychology," 3440 . If possible , we should use a random sample ( there are other types of samples , but for the purposes of this chapter , we will focus on random samples ) .","0"
psychology," A random sample is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected .","1"
psychology," Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population .","0"
psychology," 3443 . Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups , a statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups .","0"
psychology," A statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance ( and thus not meaningful ) .","0"
psychology," 3446 . Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection .","0"
psychology," Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result .","1"
psychology," In the context of psychological research , this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent , reproducible ways .","0"
psychology," 3449 . If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior , focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole .","0"
psychology," Generalizing refers to the ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society .","1"
psychology," Again , case studies provide enormous amounts of information , but since the cases are so specific , the potential to apply what ’s learned to the average person may be very limited .","0"
psychology," 3452 . The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity , or accuracy , of information collected unobtrusively in a natural setting .","0"
psychology," Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity , or realism , than we might achieve with other research approaches .","1"
psychology," 3455 . Often , psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data .","0"
psychology," Surveys are lists of questions to be answered by research participants , and can be delivered as paper - and - pencil questionnaires , administered electronically , or conducted verbally ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Generally , the survey itself can be completed in a short time , and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people .","0"
psychology," 3458 . When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time , we are conducting longitudinal research .","1"
psychology," Longitudinal research is a research design in which data - gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time .","1"
psychology," For example , we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age 20 , retest them a decade later at age 30 , and then again at age 40 .","0"
psychology," 3461 . In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others , such as intuition and personal experience , the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim .","0"
psychology," Scientific knowledge is empirical : It is grounded in objective , tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again , regardless of who is observing . While behavior is observable , the mind is not .","1"
psychology," If someone is crying , we can see behavior .","0"
psychology," 3464 . Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .","1"
psychology," In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research .","0"
psychology," THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH","0"
psychology," Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .","0"
psychology," Basically , ideas ( in the form of theories and hypotheses ) are tested against the real world ( in the form of empirical observations ) , and those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world , and so on .","1"
psychology," 3467 . A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct , and it is often worded as an if - then statement ( e.g. , if I study all night , I will get a passing grade on the test ) .","1"
psychology," The hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world .","0"
psychology," 3470 . Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ) ; in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly .","1"
psychology," The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .","0"
psychology," 3473 . In most areas of psychology , this means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology .","0"
psychology," Literally , PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree , but here , philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se .","1"
psychology," Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .","0"
psychology," 3476 . Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree , which is known as a PsyD .","0"
psychology," A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology .","0"
psychology," PsyD programs generally place less emphasis on research - oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context ( Norcorss & Castle , 2002 ) .","0"
psychology," 3479 . Evolutionary psychology , and specifically , the evolutionary psychology of humans , has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades .","0"
psychology," To be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause .","0"
psychology," 3482 . Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan .","1"
psychology," Developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation .","0"
psychology," 3485 . More recently , the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach .","0"
psychology," Rather than explaining how personality arises , research is focused on identifying personality traits , measuring these traits , and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation .","0"
psychology," Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .","1"
psychology," 3488 . Until then , you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted .","0"
psychology," Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience .","0"
psychology," After the holocaust , in 1961 , a Nazi war criminal , Adolf Eichmann , who was accused of committing mass atrocities , was put on trial .","0"
psychology," 3491 . Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors . This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Health psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy , education , intervention , and research .","0"
psychology," 3494 . As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .","0"
psychology," Counseling psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional , social , vocational , and health - related outcomes in individuals who are considered psychologically healthy .","1"
psychology," 3497 . Wilhelm Wundt ( 1832–1920 ) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist .","0"
psychology," His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873 .","0"
psychology," 3500 . William James ( 1842 – 1910 ) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," James was introduced to Darwin ’s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’s characteristics .","0"
psychology," 3503 . According to Freud , the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis , by examinations of the first words that came to people ’s minds , and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue .","0"
psychology," Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person ’s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .","1"
psychology," 3506 . John B. Watson ( 1878 – 1958 ) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience , Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed .","0"
psychology," 3509 . The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button .","1"
psychology," When the animal pushes the button or lever , the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior ( such as food ) or a punishment ( such as a noise ) or a token conditioner ( such as a light ) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment .","0"
psychology," 3512 . Carl Rogers ( 1902 – 1987 ) was also an American psychologist who , like Maslow , emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client - centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy .","0"
psychology," 3515 . We might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep .","0"
psychology," Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .","1"
psychology," Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .","1"
psychology," 3518 . This pattern of temperature fluctuation , which repeats every day , is one example of a circadian rhythm .","0"
psychology," A circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours .","1"
psychology," Our sleep - wake cycle , which is linked to our environment ’s natural light - dark cycle , is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm , but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate , blood pressure , blood sugar , and body temperature .","0"
psychology," 3521 . The brain ’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) .","0"
psychology," The axons of light - sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the amount of light present , allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world ( Klein , Moore , & Reppert , 1991 ; Welsh , Takahashi , & Kay , 2010 ) ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3524 . These individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person ’s chronotype , and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation ( Taillard , Philip , Coste , Sagaspe , & Bioulac , 2003 ) .","1"
psychology," Sleep regulation refers to the brain ’s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world .","1"
psychology," 3527 . Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles .","0"
psychology," Rotating shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis .","1"
psychology," For example , a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday , 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday , and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday .","0"
psychology," 3530 . Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation .","0"
psychology," Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep - deprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for sleep .","1"
psychology," Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography ( EEG ) , and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," This is a segment of a polysonograph ( PSG ) , a recording of several physical variables during sleep .","1"
psychology," 3533 . Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .","0"
psychology," In contrast , non - REM ( NREM ) sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves .","0"
psychology," The first four stages of sleep are NREM sleep , while the fifth and final stage of sleep is REM sleep .","0"
psychology," 3536 . As an individual continues through stage 1 sleep , there is an increase in theta wave activity .","0"
psychology," Theta waves are even lower frequency ( 4 – 7 Hz ) , higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves .","1"
psychology," It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1 sleep ; in fact , people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep .","0"
psychology," 3539 . In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .","0"
psychology," A K - complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli .","1"
psychology," Thus , K - complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments ( Halász , 1993 ; Steriade & Amzica , 1998 ) .","0"
psychology," 3542 . Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams .","0"
psychology," Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .","1"
psychology," Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .","1"
psychology," 3545 . Among a variety of neurobiological evidence , John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general .","0"
psychology," Lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state .","1"
psychology," In a lucid dream , a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming , and as such , they can control the dream ’s content ( LaBerge , 1990 ) .","0"
psychology," 3548 . In sleepwalking , or somnambulism , the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from wandering about to driving an automobile .","1"
psychology," During periods of sleepwalking , sleepers often have their eyes open , but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them .","0"
psychology," 3551 . Night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to escape from the immediate environment ( Mahowald & Schenck , 2000 ) .","1"
psychology," Although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake , they generally have no memories of the events that occurred , and attempts to console them are ineffective .","0"
psychology," 3554 . Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .","1"
psychology," In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005 ) .","1"
psychology," One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .","0"
psychology," A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .","1"
psychology," 3557 . Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .","0"
psychology," These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .","1"
psychology," 3560 . A person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences .","0"
psychology," In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .","1"
psychology," In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .","1"
psychology," 3563 . Drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued .","1"
psychology," These symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug .","0"
psychology," 3566 . In recent years , methamphetamine ( meth ) use has become increasingly widespread .","0"
psychology," Methamphetamine is a type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available ( e.g. , medications containing pseudoephedrine , a compound found in many over - the - counter cold and flu remedies ) .","1"
psychology," Despite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult , methamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option ( Shukla , Crump , & Chrisco , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," 3569 . Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like cigarettes or chewing tobacco ; therefore , there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking cessation techniques .","0"
psychology," To date , people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition to various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products .","0"
psychology," In general , smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term , but it is unclear whether these effects persist ( Cropley , Theadom , Pravettoni , & Webb , 2008 ; Levitt , Shaw , Wong , & Kaczorowski , 2007 ; Smedslund , Fisher , Boles , & Lichtenstein , 2004 ) .","0"
psychology," 3572 . Still , people experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult .","0"
psychology," Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .","1"
psychology," Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .","0"
psychology," 3575 . A hallucinogen is one of a class of drugs that results in profound alterations in sensory and perceptual experiences ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," In some cases , users experience vivid visual hallucinations .","0"
psychology," 3578 . Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli .","1"
psychology," When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor , sensation has occurred .","0"
psychology," For example , light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye .","0"
psychology," 3581 . It has been estimated that on a clear night , the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame 30 miles away ( Okawa & Sampath , 2007 ) .","0"
psychology," Under quiet conditions , the hair cells ( the receptor cells of the inner ear ) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away ( Galanter , 1962 ) .","0"
psychology," It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness — these are called subliminal messages .","1"
psychology," A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain : This is an absolute threshold .","0"
psychology," 3584 . Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .","0"
psychology," Bottom - up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input .","1"
psychology," On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .","0"
psychology," 3587 . Because participants were so focused on the number of times the white team was passing the ball , they completely tuned out other visual information .","0"
psychology," Failure to notice something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention is called inattentional blindness .","1"
psychology," 3590 . For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .","0"
psychology," One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) : The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .","0"
psychology," 3593 . Wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form .","0"
psychology," Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz ( Hz ) , or cycles per second .","1"
psychology," Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies , and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3596 . Higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds .","0"
psychology," Loudness is measured in terms of decibels ( dB ) , a logarithmic unit of sound intensity .","1"
psychology," A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB ; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3599 . Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .","0"
psychology," The cornea is the transparent covering over the eye .","1"
psychology," It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .","0"
psychology," 3602 . After passing through the pupil , light crosses the lens , a curved , transparent structure that serves to provide additional focus .","1"
psychology," The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .","0"
psychology," 3605 . These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .","0"
psychology," The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .","1"
psychology," Cones are very sensitive to acute detail and provide tremendous spatial resolution .","0"
psychology," 3608 . The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .","0"
psychology," There is a point in the visual field called the blind spot : Even when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot , we do not see it .","1"
psychology," We are not consciously aware of our blind spots for two reasons : First , each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field ; therefore , the blind spots do not overlap .","0"
psychology," 3611 . Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light .","0"
psychology," According to the trichromatic theory of color vision , shown in [ link ] , all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining red , green , and blue .","1"
psychology," The three types of cones are each receptive to one of the colors .","0"
psychology," 3617 . Generally , you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D .","0"
psychology," When we do this , we are relying on a number of monocular cues , or cues that require only one eye .","1"
psychology," If you think you ca n’t see depth with one eye , note that you do n’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking — and , in fact , we have more monocular cues than binocular cues .","0"
psychology," 3620 . The outer ear includes the pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads , the auditory canal , and the tympanic membrane , or eardrum . The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles , which are named the malleus ( or hammer ) , incus ( or anvil ) , and the stapes ( or stirrup ) .","1"
psychology," The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .","1"
psychology," 3623 . As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane .","0"
psychology," The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea .","1"
psychology," 3626 . The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing .","0"
psychology," Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .","0"
psychology," 3629 . Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .","1"
psychology," Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates ( Grothe et al . , 2010 ) .","0"
psychology," 3635 . One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .","0"
psychology," Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .","0"
psychology," 3638 . Taste ( gustation ) and smell ( olfaction ) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe .","0"
psychology," There is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses .","0"
psychology," 3644 . Many species respond to chemical messages , known as pheromones , sent by another individual ( Wysocki & Preti , 2004 ) .","1"
psychology," Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate .","0"
psychology," 3650 . Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain .","1"
psychology," This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain ( or congenital analgesia ) .","0"
psychology," While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure , they can not experience pain .","0"
psychology," 3653 . Wertheimer , and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka , who later became his partners , believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli .","1"
psychology," This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology .","0"
psychology," The word gestalt literally means form or pattern , but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts .","0"
psychology," 3656 . We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields .","0"
psychology," According to this principle , things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3659 . According to Gestalt theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above .","0"
psychology," You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .","0"
psychology," 3662 . Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .","0"
psychology," Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .","0"
psychology," For instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person ( Payne , 2001 ; Payne , Shimizu , & Jacoby , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," 3665 . Learning , like reflexes and instincts , allows an organism to adapt to its environment .","0"
psychology," But unlike instincts and reflexes , learned behaviors involve change and experience : learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience .","1"
psychology," In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience .","0"
psychology," 3668 . Pavlov ( 1849 – 1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events .","0"
psychology," Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .","0"
psychology," 3671 . The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .","1"
psychology," The dogs ’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .","1"
psychology," Before conditioning , think of the dogs ’ stimulus and response like this :","0"
psychology," 3674 . Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants ’ footsteps .","0"
psychology," The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( CR ) .","1"
psychology," In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food .","0"
psychology," 3677 . Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something ingested ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( nausea or illness ) .","1"
psychology," Here ’s how it works .","0"
psychology," 3680 . Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) .","0"
psychology," When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination .","1"
psychology," In classical conditioning terms , the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus .","0"
psychology," 3683 . John B. Watson , shown in [ link ] , is considered the founder of behaviorism .","0"
psychology," Behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century , which incorporates elements of Pavlov ’s classical conditioning ( Hunt , 2007 ) .","1"
psychology," 3686 . Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments .","0"
psychology," His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .","0"
psychology," According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .","1"
psychology," 3689 . In negative reinforcement , an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior .","1"
psychology," For example , car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems , which go “ beep , beep , beep ” until you fasten your seatbelt .","0"
psychology," 3692 . In this case , a stimulus ( the reprimand ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( texting in class ) .","0"
psychology," In negative punishment , you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior .","1"
psychology," For example , when a child misbehaves , a parent can take away a favorite toy .","0"
psychology," 3695 . A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer .","1"
psychology," Praise , linked to affection , is one example of a secondary reinforcer , as when you called out “ Great shot ! ” every time Joaquin made a goal .","0"
psychology," 3698 . Now let ’s combine these four terms .","0"
psychology," A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time .","1"
psychology," For example , June undergoes major surgery in a hospital .","0"
psychology," 3701 . In a variable ratio reinforcement schedule , the number of responses needed for a reward varies .","1"
psychology," This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule .","0"
psychology," 3704 . As soon as the rats became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the maze quickly , just as quickly as the comparison group , which had been rewarded with food all along .","0"
psychology," This is known as latent learning : learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it . Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze .","1"
psychology," Have you ever worked your way through various levels on a video game ?","0"
psychology," 3707 . Imitation is much more obvious in humans , but is imitation really the sincerest form of flattery ?","0"
psychology," Consider Claire ’s experience with observational learning .","0"
psychology," 3710 . On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .","1"
psychology," This is called vicarious punishment .","0"
psychology," For example , imagine that four - year - old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother ’s makeup , and then saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in .","0"
psychology," 3713 . Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think .","1"
psychology," It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .","0"
psychology," 3716 . In psychology , concepts can be divided into two categories , natural and artificial .","0"
psychology," Natural concepts are created “ naturally ” through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences .","1"
psychology," For example , if you live in Essex Junction , Vermont , you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow .","0"
psychology," 3719 . There are several types of schemata .","0"
psychology," A role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave ( Callero , 1994 ) .","1"
psychology," For example , imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter .","0"
psychology," 3722 . Language , be it spoken , signed , or written , has specific components : a lexicon and grammar .","0"
psychology," Lexicon refers to the words of a given language .","1"
psychology," Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .","0"
psychology," 3725 . A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .","1"
psychology," Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .","1"
psychology," We use semantics and syntax to construct language .","0"
psychology," 3728 . However , young children master language very quickly with relative ease .","0"
psychology," B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .","0"
psychology," Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .","0"
psychology," 3731 . A problem - solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution .","0"
psychology," Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3734 . A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy .","0"
psychology," While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result , a heuristic is a general problem - solving framework ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) .","1"
psychology," You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems .","0"
psychology," 3737 . Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you can not perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for .","1"
psychology," During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon , NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft .","0"
psychology," 3740 . For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .","0"
psychology," Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .","1"
psychology," In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .","0"
psychology," Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .","1"
psychology," 3746 . James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," From a biological perspective , an instinct is a species - specific pattern of behavior that is not learned .","1"
psychology," There was , however , considerable controversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct .","0"
psychology," 3749 . Researchers Robert Yerkes ( pronounced “ Yerk - EES ” ) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," This relationship is known as Yerkes - Dodson law , which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower .","1"
psychology," 3752 . Maslow ’s Hierarchy of NeedsWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives , individual characteristics , or social contexts , Abraham Maslow ( 1943 ) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social .","0"
psychology," These needs are often depicted as a pyramid ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3758 . Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation .","1"
psychology," Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well - developed short story .","0"
psychology," 3764 . Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem .","1"
psychology," In contrast , convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well - established answer or solution to a problem ( Cropley , 2006 ; Gilford , 1967 )","1"
psychology," 3767 . The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain .","0"
psychology," Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs ( Ahima & Antwi , 2008 ; Woods & D’Alessio , 2008 ) .","0"
psychology," 3770 . OBESITY","0"
psychology," When someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height , they are considered overweight or obese .","0"
psychology," According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .","1"
psychology," 3773 . In cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity , bariatric surgery may be recommended .","0"
psychology," Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weight reduction , and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten and/or limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed ( [ link ] ) ( Mayo Clinic , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," A recent meta - analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non - surgical treatment for obesity in the two - years immediately following the procedure , but to date , no long - term studies yet exist ( Gloy et al . , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," 3776 . As of the 2013 release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , fifth edition , Binge eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .","0"
psychology," Unlike with bulimia , eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior , such as purging , but they are followed by distress , including feelings of guilt and embarrassment .","0"
psychology," 3779 . Physicians were considered authorities on all issues related to sex , despite the fact that they had little to no training in these issues , and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by talking with their peers .","0"
psychology," Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on issues related to human sexuality , Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large - scale survey research on the topic ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The results of some of these efforts were published in two books — Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female — which were published in 1948 and 1953 , respectively ( Bullough , 1998 ) .","0"
psychology," 3782 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .","1"
psychology," 3785 . Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .","0"
psychology," Orgasm is marked in women by rhythmic contractions of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension .","0"
psychology," In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .","0"
psychology," 3788 . In reality , these are two related , but different , issues .","0"
psychology," Gender identity refers to one ’s sense of being male or female .","1"
psychology," Generally , our gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex , but this is not always the case .","0"
psychology," 3791 . While you ’re likely familiar with the term “ IQ ” and associate it with the idea of intelligence , what does IQ really mean ?","0"
psychology," IQ stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measure intelligence .","1"
psychology," You ’ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence ( or more aptly , intelligences ) .","0"
psychology," 3794 . Interestingly , the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the Flynn effect .","0"
psychology," Named after James Flynn , who was among the first to describe this trend , the Flynn effect refers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last .","1"
psychology," Flynn himself argues , however , that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se ( Flynn , Shaughnessy , & Fulgham , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," 3797 . Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person ’s parents .","0"
psychology," Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of intelligence .","0"
psychology," The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well - known twin studies .","0"
psychology," 3800 . Children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly .","1"
psychology," The physical task of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person .","0"
psychology," 3803 . Emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional .","0"
psychology," Mood , on the other hand , refers to a prolonged , less intense , affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience .","1"
psychology," Mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion ( Beedie , Terry , Lane , & Devonport , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," 3806 . Other theorists , however , doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience .","0"
psychology," Thus , the Cannon - Bard theory of emotion was developed .","0"
psychology," According to this view , physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously , yet independently ( Lang , 1994 ) .","1"
psychology," 3809 . The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them , and the order in which these occur , remains a topic of research and debate .","0"
psychology," Lazarus ( 1991 ) developed the cognitive - mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus .","1"
psychology," This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response , and it is immediate and often unconscious .","0"
psychology," 3812 . The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," The basolateral complex has dense connections with a variety of sensory areas of the brain .","1"
psychology," It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .","0"
psychology," 3815 . Culture can impact the way in which people display emotion .","0"
psychology," A cultural display rule is one of a collection of culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable ( Malatesta & Haviland , 1982 ) .","1"
psychology," Therefore , people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion .","0"
psychology," 3818 . We also use the tone of our voices , various behaviors , and body language to communicate information about our emotional states .","0"
psychology," Body language is the expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement .","1"
psychology," Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language , even if we ’re not consciously aware of it ( de Gelder , 2006 ; Tamietto et al . , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," 3821 . In the centuries after Galen , other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary temperament types , most prominently Immanuel Kant ( in the 18th century ) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt ( in the 19th century ) ( Eysenck , 2009 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ; Wundt , 1874 / 1886 ) ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Kant agreed with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap between the four categories ( Eysenck , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," 3824 . LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS","0"
psychology," To explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience , Freud compared the mind to an iceberg ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," He said that only about one - tenth of our mind is conscious , and the rest of our mind is unconscious .","0"
psychology," Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access ( Freud , 1923 ) .","1"
psychology," 3827 . It strives for perfection and judges our behavior , leading to feelings of pride or — when we fall short of the ideal — feelings of guilt .","0"
psychology," In contrast to the instinctual i d and the rule - based superego , the ego is the rational part of our personality .","1"
psychology," It ’s what Freud considered to be the self , and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others .","0"
psychology," 3830 . Eventually you forget about it .","0"
psychology," Similarly , in the human psyche , if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with , it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness ( Freud , 1920 ) .","0"
psychology," This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas .","0"
psychology," 3833 . For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .","0"
psychology," In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .","1"
psychology," Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .","0"
psychology," 3836 . In the oral stage ( birth to 1 year ) , pleasure is focused on the mouth .","1"
psychology," Eating and the pleasure derived from sucking ( nipples , pacifiers , and thumbs ) play a large part in a baby ’s first year of life .","0"
psychology," 3839 . Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period ( 6 years to puberty ) .","1"
psychology," This period is not considered a stage , because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits , such as school , friendships , hobbies , and sports .","0"
psychology," 3842 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .","1"
psychology," Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .","0"
psychology," 3845 . Carl Jung ( [ link ] ) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud , who later split off from Freud and developed his own theory , which he called analytical psychology .","0"
psychology," The focus of analytical psychology is on working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought , and experience within one ’s personality .","1"
psychology," 3848 . Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst .","0"
psychology," During the Great Depression , Horney moved from Germany to the United States , and subsequently moved away from Freud ’s teachings .","0"
psychology," 3851 . If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today , more than likely you could recall this information quite easily .","0"
psychology," This is known as automatic processing , or the encoding of details like time , space , frequency , and the meaning of words .","1"
psychology," Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness .","0"
psychology," 3854 . Visual encoding is the encoding of images , and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds , words in particular .","1"
psychology," To see how visual encoding works , read over this list of words : car , level , dog , truth , book , value .","0"
psychology," 3857 . Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .","1"
psychology," In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .","0"
psychology," These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .","0"
psychology," 3860 . One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short - term memory storage .","0"
psychology," J. R. Stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s : you will name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color , which is called the Stroop effect .","1"
psychology," In other words , the word “ red ” will be named more quickly , regardless of the color the word appears in , than any word that is colored red .","0"
psychology," 3863 . Long - term memory ( LTM ) is the continuous storage of information .","1"
psychology," Unlike short - term memory , the storage capacity of LTM has no limits .","0"
psychology," 3866 . Procedural memory is a type of implicit memory : it stores information about how to do things .","1"
psychology," It is the memory for skilled actions , such as how to brush your teeth , how to drive a car , how to swim the crawl ( freestyle ) stroke .","0"
psychology," 3869 . Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced .","1"
psychology," The concept of episodic memory was first proposed about 40 years ago ( Tulving , 1972 ) .","0"
psychology," 3872 . How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it ?","0"
psychology," The act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval .","1"
psychology," This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer ’s hard drive .","0"
psychology," 3875 . The third form of retrieval is relearning , and it ’s just what it sounds like .","0"
psychology," It involves learning information that you previously learned .","1"
psychology," 3878 . First , let ’s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation .","0"
psychology," The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions , such as fear and aggression ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3881 . There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory , such as epinephrine , dopamine , serotonin , glutamate , and acetylcholine ( Myhrer , 2003 ) .","0"
psychology," There continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role ( Blockland , 1996 ) .","0"
psychology," Although we do n’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory , we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories .","0"
psychology," 3884 . In other words , people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning .","0"
psychology," B. F. Skinner , a strict behaviorist , believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior , including the enduring , consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists .","0"
psychology," 3887 . In contrast to Skinner ’s idea that the environment alone determines behavior , Bandura ( 1990 ) proposed the concept of reciprocal determinism , in which cognitive processes , behavior , and context all interact , each factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," Cognitive processes refer to all characteristics previously learned , including beliefs , expectations , and personality characteristics .","1"
psychology," 3890 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .","0"
psychology," Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .","1"
psychology," In Rotter ’s view , people possess either an internal or an external locus of control ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3893 . Anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma , such as a blow to the head .","0"
psychology," With anterograde amnesia , you can not remember new information , although you can remember information and events that happened prior to your injury .","1"
psychology," The hippocampus is usually affected ( McLeod , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," 3896 . Because memory is so fragile , witnesses can be easily ( and often accidentally ) misled due to the problem of suggestibility .","0"
psychology," Suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sources that leads to the creation of false memories .","1"
psychology," In the fall of 2002 , a sniper in the DC area shot people at a gas station , leaving Home Depot , and walking down the street .","0"
psychology," 3899 . She has studied false memories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse .","0"
psychology," Loftus also developed the misinformation effect paradigm , which holds that after exposure to incorrect information , a person may misremember the original event .","1"
psychology," 3902 . Let ’s look at the first sin of the forgetting errors : transience , which means that memories can fade over time .","1"
psychology," Here ’s an example of how this happens .","0"
psychology," 3905 . Now let ’s take a look at the three errors of distortion : misattribution , suggestibility , and bias .","0"
psychology," Misattribution happens when you confuse the source of your information .","1"
psychology," Let ’s say Alejandro was dating Lucia and they saw the first Hobbit movie together .","0"
psychology," 3908 . When the new year starts , do you find you accidentally write the previous year ?","0"
psychology," These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .","1"
psychology," Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .","1"
psychology," 3911 . This perspective focuses on how healthy people develop .","0"
psychology," One pioneering humanist , Abraham Maslow , studied people who he considered to be healthy , creative , and productive , including Albert Einstein , Eleanor Roosevelt , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln , and others .","0"
psychology," Maslow ( 1950 , 1970 ) found that such people share similar characteristics , such as being open , creative , loving , spontaneous , compassionate , concerned for others , and accepting of themselves .","0"
psychology," 3914 . Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves .","0"
psychology," We experience congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar — in other words , when our self - concept is accurate .","1"
psychology," High congruence leads to a greater sense of self - worth and a healthy , productive life .","0"
psychology," 3917 . To help make sure information goes from short - term memory to long - term memory , you can use memory - enhancing strategies .","0"
psychology," One strategy is rehearsal , or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered ( Craik & Watkins , 1973 ) .","1"
psychology," Think about how you learned your multiplication tables as a child .","0"
psychology," 3920 . Mnemonic devices are memory aids that help us organize information for encoding ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," They are especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps , stages , phases , and parts of a system ( Bellezza , 1981 ) .","0"
psychology," 3923 . Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain , the senses , motor skills , and health and wellness .","1"
psychology," Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .","1"
psychology," Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .","1"
psychology," 3926 . This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ” In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) .","0"
psychology," Although children develop at slightly different rates , we can use these age - related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same - age peers to determine the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones ( e.g. , crawling , walking , writing , dressing , naming colors , speaking in sentences , and starting puberty ) .","0"
psychology," 3932 . These findings suggest the heritability of some personality traits .","0"
psychology," Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to genetics .","1"
psychology," Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include leadership , obedience to authority , a sense of well - being , alienation , resistance to stress , and fearfulness .","0"
psychology," 3935 . Freud viewed development as discontinuous ; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood , and that if we lack proper nurturance and parenting during a stage , we may become stuck , or fixated , in that stage .","0"
psychology," Freud ’s stages are called the stages of psychosexual development .","0"
psychology," According to Freud , children ’s pleasure - seeking urges are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone , at each of the five stages of development : oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital . While most of Freud ’s ideas have not found support in modern research , we can not discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology .","1"
psychology," 3941 . First , they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata : assimilation is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know .","1"
psychology," Accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on new information .","1"
psychology," This process continues as children interact with their environment .","0"
psychology," 3944 . Piaget ’s second stage is the preoperational stage , which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old .","1"
psychology," In this stage , children can use symbols to represent words , images , and ideas , which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play .","0"
psychology," 3947 . Piaget ’s third stage is the concrete operational stage , which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old .","1"
psychology," In this stage , children can think logically about real ( concrete ) events ; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ memory strategies .","0"
psychology," 3950 . A major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong .","0"
psychology," Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg ( 1927–1987 ) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regarding cognitive development .","0"
psychology," Kohlberg believed that moral development , like cognitive development , follows a series of stages .","0"
psychology," 3953 . The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels .","0"
psychology," Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .","1"
psychology," Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .","1"
psychology," 3956 . Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings .","1"
psychology," In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .","1"
psychology," An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .","1"
psychology," 3962 . When you do well at a task , for example acing an exam , it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior ( “ I ’m smart , ” ) instead of a situational one ( “ The exam was easy , ” ) .","0"
psychology," The tendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive outcomes but situational or external attributions for negative outcomes is known as the self - serving bias ( Miller & Ross , 1975 ) .","1"
psychology," This bias serves to protect self - esteem .","0"
psychology," 3968 . During the first week after conception , the zygote divides and multiplies , going from a one - cell structure to two cells , then four cells , then eight cells , and so on .","1"
psychology," This process of cell division is called mitosis .","0"
psychology," Mitosis is a fragile process , and fewer than one - half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks ( Hall , 2004 ) .","0"
psychology," 3971 . The developing fetus is completely dependent on the mother for life .","0"
psychology," It is important that the mother takes good care of herself and receives prenatal care , which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the mother and the fetus ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," According to the National Institutes of Health ( [ NIH ] , 2013 ) , routine prenatal care is important because it can reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy .","0"
psychology," 3974 . Although small , a newborn is not completely helpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth .","0"
psychology," All healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes : inborn automatic responses to particular forms of stimulation .","1"
psychology," Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors — these reflexes are crucial to survival .","0"
psychology," 3977 . Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .","1"
psychology," Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .","1"
psychology," 3980 . A fourth style , known as disorganized attachment , was later described ( Main & Solomon , 1990 ) .","0"
psychology," The most common type of attachment — also considered the healthiest — is called secure attachment ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," In this type of attachment , the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger .","0"
psychology," 3986 . For parents who employ the permissive style of parenting , the kids run the show and anything goes .","0"
psychology," Permissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment .","0"
psychology," 3989 . In pre - industrial society , children were considered adults when they reached physical maturity , but today we have an extended time between childhood and adulthood called adolescence .","0"
psychology," Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends at emerging adulthood , which is discussed later .","1"
psychology," In the United States , adolescence is seen as a time to develop independence from parents while remaining connected to them ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 3992 . Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .","1"
psychology," Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .","1"
psychology," Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .","1"
psychology," 3998 . One major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles .","0"
psychology," A social role is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group ( Hare , 2003 ) .","1"
psychology," Each one of us has several social roles .","0"
psychology," 4001 . Because of social roles , people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific , familiar settings .","0"
psychology," A script is a person ’s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting ( Schank & Abelson , 1977 ) .","1"
psychology," How do you act on the first day of school , when you walk into an elevator , or are at a restaurant ?","0"
psychology," 4004 . Visit this website to hear an NPR interview with Philip Zimbardo where he discusses the parallels between the Stanford prison experiment and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .","0"
psychology," 4007 . When we experience cognitive dissonance , we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically , physically , and mentally uncomfortable .","0"
psychology," We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them harmonious .","0"
psychology," This can be done in different ways , such as :","0"
psychology," 4010 . In the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change our attitudes , behaviors , and/or cognitions to make them consonant .","0"
psychology," Persuasion is the process of changing our attitude toward something based on some kind of communication .","1"
psychology," Much of the persuasion we experience comes from outside forces .","0"
psychology," 4016 . One effective strategy is the foot - in - the - door technique ( Cialdini , 2001 ; Pliner , Hart , Kohl , & Saari , 1974 ) .","0"
psychology," Using the foot - in - the - door technique , the persuader gets a person to agree to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item , only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item .","1"
psychology," The foot - in - the - door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser ( 1966 ) in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," 4019 . Asch ( 1955 ) found that 76 % of participants conformed to group pressure at least once by indicating the incorrect line .","0"
psychology," Conformity is the change in a person ’s behavior to go along with the group , even if he does not agree with the group .","1"
psychology," Why would people give the wrong answer ?","0"
psychology," 4025 . Stanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf Eichmann , a Nazi war criminal .","1"
psychology," Eichmann ’s defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was “ just following orders . ” Milgram ( 1963 ) wanted to test the validity of this defense , so he designed an experiment and initially recruited 40 men for his experiment .","0"
psychology," 4028 . Another phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization .","0"
psychology," Group polarization ( Teger & Pruitt , 1967 ) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group .","1"
psychology," That is , if a group initially favors a viewpoint , after discussion the group consensus is likely a stronger endorsement of the viewpoint .","0"
psychology," 4031 . It impacts their lives and their family ’s lives in positive and negative physical and psychological ways .","0"
psychology," Industrial and organizational ( I - O ) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work .","1"
psychology," 4034 . As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships , organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment , including sexual harassment , and workplace violence .","0"
psychology," Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and how to design those tools to optimize workers ’ productivity , safety , and health .","1"
psychology," These studies can involve interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk , chair , and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at the desk using the computer for several hours each day .","0"
psychology," 4037 . Analysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the Hawthorne effect , which describes the increase in performance of individuals who are noticed , watched , and paid attention to by researchers or supervisors [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," What the original researchers found was that any change in a variable , such as lighting levels , led to an improvement in productivity ; this was true even when the change was negative , such as a return to poor lighting .","0"
psychology," 4040 . Today , I - O psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice , as you will learn about in the rest of this chapter .","0"
psychology," The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology ( SIOP ) , a division of the APA , lists 8,000 members ( SIOP , 2014 ) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics — U.S .","0"
psychology," Department of Labor ( 2013 ) has projected this profession will have the greatest growth of all job classifications in the 20 years following 2012 .","0"
psychology," On average , a person with a master ’s degree in industrial - organizational psychology will earn over $ 80,000 a year , while someone with a doctorate will earn over $ 110,000 a year ( Khanna , Medsker , & Ginter , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," 4043 . Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination .","0"
psychology," Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one ’s membership in a particular group ( Allport , 1954 ; Dovidio & Gaertner , 2004 ) .","1"
psychology," As a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice poorly , such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends .","0"
psychology," 4049 . Prejudice and discrimination persist in society due to social learning and conformity to social norms .","0"
psychology," Children learn prejudiced attitudes and beliefs from society : their parents , teachers , friends , the media , and other sources of socialization , such as Facebook ( O’Keeffe & Clarke - Pearson , 2011 ) .","0"
psychology," 4052 . When interacting with the target of our prejudice , we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations and ignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations .","0"
psychology," In this process , known as confirmation bias , we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with our stereotypes ( Wason & Johnson - Laird , 1972 ) .","1"
psychology," In the job interview example , the employer may not have noticed that the job applicant was friendly and engaging , and that he provided competent responses to the interview questions in the beginning of the interview .","0"
psychology," 4055 . Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in - groups , we develop in - group bias : a preference for our own group over other groups .","1"
psychology," This in - group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out - group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in - group .","0"
psychology," 4058 . Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .","0"
psychology," Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .","1"
psychology," In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .","1"
psychology," 4061 . One form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying .","0"
psychology," Bullying is repeated negative treatment of another person , often an adolescent , over time ( Olweus , 1993 ) .","1"
psychology," A one - time incident in which one child hits another child on the playground would not be considered bullying : Bullying is repeated behavior .","0"
psychology," 4064 . This is a common occurrence , as the following well - publicized event demonstrates .","0"
psychology," In 1964 , in Queens , New York , a 19-year - old woman named Kitty Genovese was attacked by a person with a knife near the back entrance to her apartment building and again in the hallway inside her apartment building .","0"
psychology," When the attack occurred , she screamed for help numerous times and eventually died from her stab wounds .","0"
psychology," 4070 . When you and another person share similar music taste , hobbies , food preferences , and so on , deciding what to do with your time together might be easy .","0"
psychology," Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks , including friendships , marriage , business relationships , and many other types of relationships , with others who are similar ( McPherson et al . , 2001 ) .","1"
psychology," 4073 . Robert Sternberg ( 1986 ) proposed that there are three components of love : intimacy , passion , and commitment .","0"
psychology," These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of love : this is known as Sternberg ’s triangular theory of love ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Intimacy is the sharing of details and intimate thoughts and emotions .","1"
psychology," 4076 . Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships , consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion .","1"
psychology," Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment .","1"
psychology," Finally , fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment , but no intimacy , such as a long term sexual love affair .","1"
psychology," 4079 . This allows the I - O psychologist to access previous analyses for nearly any type of occupation .","0"
psychology," This system is called O*Net ( accessible at www.online.onetcenter.org ) .","0"
psychology," The site is open and you can see the KSAs that are listed for your own position or one you might be curious about .","0"
psychology," 4082 . Unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance , a decision based on group membership is discriminatory ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," To combat hiring discrimination , in the United States there are numerous city , state , and federal laws that prevent hiring based on various group - membership criteria .","0"
psychology," For example , did you know it is illegal for a potential employer to ask your age in an interview ?","0"
psychology," 4085 . The Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act make provisions for bona fide occupational qualifications ( BFOQs ) , which are requirements of certain occupations for which denying an individual employment would otherwise violate the law .","1"
psychology," For example , there may be cases in which religion , national origin , age , and sex are bona fide occupational qualifications .","0"
psychology," 4088 . Job stress affects job satisfaction .","0"
psychology," Job stress , or job strain , is caused by specific stressors in an occupation .","0"
psychology," 4091 . Flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around which the employee may schedule his arrival and departure from work to meet family demands .","0"
psychology," Telecommuting involves employees working at home and setting their own hours , which allows them to work during different parts of the day , and to spend part of the day with their family .","0"
psychology," Recall that Yahoo !","0"
psychology," 4094 . In the Theory Y approach , on the other hand , managers assume that most people seek inner satisfaction and fulfillment from their work .","1"
psychology," Employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in , and provide input about , setting their personal and work goals .","0"
psychology," 4097 . Organizations need to respond quickly to changes in these factors .","0"
psychology," Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations so that work can be delegated to work teams , which bring together diverse skills , experience , and expertise .","0"
psychology," This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base ( Naquin & Tynan , 2003 ) .","0"
psychology," 4100 . One well - recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment , including sexual harassment .","0"
psychology," Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual harassment ( or harassment in general ) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and address it when it does occur .","0"
psychology," 4103 . This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations .","0"
psychology," Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with or among employees .","1"
psychology," 4106 . The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s , but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s ( Lyon , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," Today , we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states ; for example , we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated , angry , conflicted , overwhelmed , or fatigued .","0"
psychology," 4109 . A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .","0"
psychology," A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .","1"
psychology," Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .","0"
psychology," 4112 . He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives .","0"
psychology," This kind of stress , which Selye called eustress ( from the Greek eu = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , optimal health , and performance .","1"
psychology," A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations .","0"
psychology," 4115 . As previously stated , scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century .","0"
psychology," One of the early pioneers in the study of stress was Walter Cannon , an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," In the early part of the 20th century , Cannon was the first to identify the body ’s physiological reactions to stress .","0"
psychology," 4118 . These physiological reactions were nonspecific , which means that regardless of the type of stressor , the same pattern of reactions would occur .","0"
psychology," What Selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome , the body ’s nonspecific physiological response to stress .","1"
psychology," 4121 . If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of exhaustion ensues .","0"
psychology," At this stage , the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor : the body ’s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body ’s tissues and organs .","1"
psychology," 4124 . In short bursts , this process can have some favorable effects , such as providing extra energy , improving immune system functioning temporarily , and decreasing pain sensitivity .","0"
psychology," However , extended release of cortisol — as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress — often comes at a high price .","0"
psychology," 4127 . For an individual to experience stress , he must first encounter a potential stressor .","0"
psychology," In general , stressors can be placed into one of two broad categories : chronic and acute .","0"
psychology," 4130 . The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) uses the correlational research method to identify the connection between stress and health .","1"
psychology," That is , respondents ’ LCU scores are correlated with the number or frequency of self - reported symptoms indicating health problems .","0"
psychology," 4133 . Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout , which is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one ’s job ( Maslach & Jackson , 1981 ) .","1"
psychology," Job burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs ( e.g. , social workers , teachers , therapists , and police officers ) .","0"
psychology," 4136 . In cases of comorbidity , the best treatment is thought to address both ( or multiple ) disorders simultaneously ( NIDA , 2012 ) .","0"
psychology," Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions , and in many cases , psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy .","0"
psychology," 4139 . In a sense , the immune system is the body ’s surveillance system .","0"
psychology," It consists of a variety of structures , cells , and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading toxins and microorganisms that can harm or damage the body ’s tissues and organs .","0"
psychology," 4142 . Also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis activation can adversely impact immune function .","0"
psychology," One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that circulate in the body ’s fluids that are important in the immune response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .","1"
psychology," 4145 . A major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension , which is high blood pressure .","1"
psychology," Hypertension forces a person ’s heart to pump harder , thus putting more physical strain on the heart .","0"
psychology," 4148 . In addition to anger and hostility , a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease , including negative affectivity and depression ( Suls & Bunde , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," Negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .","1"
psychology," It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease .","0"
psychology," 4151 . Once a person seeks treatment , whether voluntarily or involuntarily , he has an intake done to assess his clinical needs .","0"
psychology," An intake is the therapist ’s first meeting with the client .","1"
psychology," 4154 . In group therapy , a clinician meets together with several clients with similar problems ( [ link ] ) .","1"
psychology," When children are placed in group therapy , it is particularly important to match clients for age and problems .","0"
psychology," 4157 . There are several different types of family therapy .","0"
psychology," In structural family therapy , the therapist examines and discusses the boundaries and structure of the family : who makes the rules , who sleeps in the bed with whom , how decisions are made , and what are the boundaries within the family .","1"
psychology," In some families , the parents do not work together to make rules , or one parent may undermine the other , leading the children to act out .","0"
psychology," 4160 . In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .","0"
psychology," Biomedical therapy involves medication and/or medical procedures to treat psychological disorders .","1"
psychology," First , we will explore the various psychotherapeutic orientations outlined in [ link ] ( many of these orientations were discussed in the Introduction chapter ) .","0"
psychology," 4163 . Consequently , a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations .","0"
psychology," In dream analysis , a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams .","1"
psychology," 4166 . Play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams or engage in traditional talk therapy .","0"
psychology," This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to “ help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth ” ( O’Connor , 2000 , p. 7 ) .","1"
psychology," 4169 . One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning : a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior .","1"
psychology," Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .","0"
psychology," 4172 . Thirty years later , Joseph Wolpe ( 1958 ) refined Jones ’s techniques , giving us the behavior therapy technique of exposure therapy that is used today .","0"
psychology," A popular form of exposure therapy is systematic desensitization , wherein a calm and pleasant state is gradually associated with increasing levels of anxiety - inducing stimuli .","1"
psychology," The idea is that you ca n’t be nervous and relaxed at the same time .","0"
psychology," 4175 . Cognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person ’s thoughts lead to feelings of distress .","1"
psychology," The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act .","0"
psychology," 4178 . One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .","0"
psychology," Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .","1"
psychology," It aims to change cognitive distortions and self - defeating behaviors .","0"
psychology," 4181 . Rogers ( 1951 ) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking help was sick and looking for a cure .","0"
psychology," Since this is a form of nondirective therapy , a therapeutic approach in which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts and understand feelings , Rogers ( 1951 ) emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own life to overcome life ’s challenges .","1"
psychology," 4184 . Another biologically based treatment that continues to be used , although infrequently , is electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) ( formerly known by its unscientific name as electroshock therapy ) .","0"
psychology," It involves using an electrical current to induce seizures to help alleviate the effects of severe depression .","1"
psychology," 4187 . As an example , suppose Bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class .","0"
psychology," If Bradford adopts a problem - focused coping approach to managing his stress , he would be proactive in trying to alleviate the source of the stress .","0"
psychology," He might contact his professor to discuss what must be done to raise his grade , he might also decide to set aside two hours daily to study statistics assignments , and he may seek tutoring assistance .","0"
psychology," 4190 . Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned helplessness : They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious stimulation they were receiving .","1"
psychology," Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression .","0"
psychology," 4193 . Their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism - related stress .","0"
psychology," The authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies : focusing on racial identity to handle race - related stress , anger expression / suppression , and seeking social support .","0"
psychology," You ’ve learned a bit about social support , so we ’ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / suppression . Focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership .","0"
psychology," 4196 . In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .","0"
psychology," The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :","1"
psychology," 4199 . For practical purposes , a precise definition of happiness might incorporate each of these elements : an enduring state of mind consisting of joy , contentment , and other positive emotions , plus the sense that one ’s life has meaning and value ( Lyubomirsky , 2001 ) .","1"
psychology," The definition implies that happiness is a long - term state — what is often characterized as subjective well - being — rather than merely a transient positive mood we all experience from time to time .","0"
psychology," 4202 . In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," In a very general sense , positive psychology can be thought of as the science of happiness ; it is an area of study that seeks to identify and promote those qualities that lead to greater fulfillment in our lives .","1"
psychology," This field looks at people ’s strengths and what helps individuals to lead happy , contented lives , and it moves away from focusing on people ’s pathology , faults , and problems .","0"
psychology," 4205 . Another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well - being is the ability to derive flow from the things we do in life .","0"
psychology," Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) .","1"
psychology," It is usually related to creative endeavors and leisure activities , but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1999 ) .","0"
psychology," 4208 . In the 19th century , Dorothea Dix led reform efforts for mental health care in the United States ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," She investigated how those who are mentally ill and poor were cared for , and she discovered an underfunded and unregulated system that perpetuated abuse of this population ( Tiffany , 1891 ) .","0"
psychology," 4211 . Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment .","0"
psychology," Voluntary treatment means the person chooses to attend therapy to obtain relief from symptoms .","1"
psychology," 4214 . He called this condition early infantile autism , and it was characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others , speech and language abnormalities , repetitive behaviors , and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal routines ( Bregman , 2005 ) .","1"
psychology," What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today , is a direct extension of Kanner ’s work .","0"
psychology," 4217 . Dissociative disorders are characterized by an individual becoming split off , or dissociated , from her core sense of self .","1"
psychology," Memory and identity become disturbed ; these disturbances have a psychological rather than physical cause .","0"
psychology," 4220 . Depersonalization / derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization , derealization , or both .","1"
psychology," Depersonalization is defined as feelings of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , one ’s whole self or from aspects of the self ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 302 ) .","0"
psychology," 4223 . By far , the most well - known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder ( formerly called multiple personality disorder ) .","0"
psychology," People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities or identities , each well - defined and distinct from one another .","1"
psychology," 4226 . Delusions are beliefs that are contrary to reality and are firmly held even in the face of contradictory evidence .","1"
psychology," Many of us hold beliefs that some would consider odd , but a delusion is easily identified because it is clearly absurd .","0"
psychology," 4232 . Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .","1"
psychology," In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .","1"
psychology," 4235 . Brain imaging studies reveal that people with schizophrenia have enlarged ventricles , the cavities within the brain that contain cerebral spinal fluid ( Green , 2001 ) .","0"
psychology," This finding is important because larger than normal ventricles suggests that various brain regions are reduced in size , thus implying that schizophrenia is associated with a loss of brain tissue .","0"
psychology," 4238 . Extremely stressful or traumatic events , such as combat , natural disasters , and terrorist attacks , place the people who experience them at an increased risk for developing psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .","0"
psychology," Throughout much of the 20th century , this disorder was called shell shock and combat neurosis because its symptoms were observed in soldiers who had engaged in wartime combat .","0"
psychology," 4241 . The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders , organized into 3 different clusters .","0"
psychology," Cluster A disorders include paranoid personality disorder , schizoid personality disorder , and schizotypal personality disorder .","1"
psychology," People with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric .","0"
psychology," 4244 . The “ borderline ” in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late 1930s in an effort to describe patients who appeared anxious , but were prone to brief psychotic experiences — that is , patients who were thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis ( Freeman , Stone , Martin , & Reinecke , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," Today , borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning .","0"
psychology," Borderline personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships , self - image , and mood , as well as marked impulsivity ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," 4247 . The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders .","0"
psychology," Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in which depression is the main feature .","1"
psychology," Depression is a vague term that , in everyday language , refers to an intense and persistent sadness .","1"
psychology," 4250 . According to the DSM-5 , the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include “ depressed mood most of the day , nearly every day ” ( feeling sad , empty , hopeless , or appearing tearful to others ) , and loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day , people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying , such as hobbies , sports , sex , social events , time spent with family , and so on .","0"
psychology," 4253 . Another subtype , peripartum onset ( commonly referred to as postpartum depression ) , applies to women who experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks .","0"
psychology," 4256 . To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder , a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in his life ; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder , they are not required for a diagnosis ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," According to the DSM-5 , a manic episode is characterized as a “ distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated , expansive , or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least one week , ” that lasts most of the time each day ( APA , 2013 , p. 124 ) .","1"
psychology," During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .","0"
psychology," 4262 . Overwhelmed by hopelessness , devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness , and burdened with the inability to adequately cope with such feelings , they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out .","0"
psychology," Suicide , defined by the CDC as “ death caused by self - directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result of the behavior ” ( CDC , 2013a ) , in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the same time Crosby , Ortega , & Melanson , 2011 ) .","1"
psychology," Not only must the person be biologically or psychologically vulnerable , but he must also have the means to perform the suicidal act , and he must lack the necessary protective factors ( e.g. , social support from friends and family , religion , coping skills , and problem - solving skills ) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain ( Berman , 2009 ) .","0"
psychology," 4268 . An individual with body dysmorphic disorder is preoccupied with a perceived flaw in her physical appearance that is either nonexistent or barely noticeable to other people ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," These perceived physical defects cause the person to think she is unattractive , ugly , hideous , or deformed .","0"
psychology," 4271 . The symptoms of OCD have been theorized to be learned responses , acquired and sustained as the result of a combination of two forms of learning : classical conditioning and operant conditioning ( Mowrer , 1960 ; Steinmetz , Tracy , & Green , 2001 ) .","0"
psychology," Specifically , the acquisition of OCD may occur first as the result of classical conditioning , whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress .","0"
psychology," 4277 . Social anxiety disorder ( formerly called social phobia ) is characterized by extreme and persistent fear or anxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively by others ( APA , 2013 ) .","1"
psychology," As with specific phobias , social anxiety disorder is common in the United States ; a little over 12 % of all Americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime ( Kessler et al . , 2005 ) .","0"
psychology," 4286 . Groups of people would suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon .","0"
psychology," This compulsion to dance — referred to as dancing mania — sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time ( [ link ] ) .","0"
psychology," Historical accounts indicate that those afflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks , screaming of terrible visions and begging priests and monks to save their souls ( Waller , 2009b ) .","0"
psychology," 4289 . A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .","1"
psychology," Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .","1"
psychology," 4292 . Violating cultural expectations is not , in and of itself , a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a psychological disorder .","0"
psychology," Since behavior varies from one culture to another , what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures .","0"
psychology," For example , returning a stranger ’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures .","0"
psychology," 4295 . How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person ’s inner states and behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder ?","0"
psychology," Arriving at a proper diagnosis — that is , appropriately identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms — is absolutely crucial .","1"
psychology," This process enables professionals to use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the patient , colleagues and the public .","0"
psychology," 4298 . A second classification system , the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) , is also widely recognized .","0"
psychology," Published by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War II and , like the DSM , has been revised several times .","0"
psychology," 4301 . In this dimension , people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers , cold , nonconformists , impulsive , antisocial , and hostile , whereas people who are high on superego control tend to have high impulse control — they are more altruistic , empathetic , cooperative , and conventional ( Eysenck , Eysenck & Barrett , 1985 ) .","0"
psychology," While Cattell ’s 16 factors may be too broad , the Eysenck ’s two - factor system has been criticized for being too narrow .","0"
psychology," Another personality theory , called the Five Factor Model , effectively hits a middle ground , with its five factors referred to as the Big Five personality traits .","0"
psychology," It is the most popular theory in personality psychology today and the most accurate approximation of the basic trait dimensions ( Funder , 2001 ) .","0"
psychology," 4304 . One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration ( Rentfrow et al . , 2013 ) .","0"
psychology," Selective migration is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs .","1"
psychology," 4307 . The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach ( pronounced “ ROAR - shock ” ) .","0"
psychology," It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a psychologist .","0"
psychology," 4310 . To address this need , Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans ( Hoy - Watkins & Jenkins - Moore , 2008 ) .","0"
psychology," The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized - Themes Concerning Blacks Test ( C - TCB ) ( Williams , 1972 ) .","0"
psychology," The C - TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African - American lifestyles .","0"
economic," 4314 . Rather , we do not have to .","0"
economic," The reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor , a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith , [ link ] , in his book , The Wealth of Nations .","0"
economic," Adam SmithAdam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks .","0"
economic," 4317 . First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .","0"
economic," ( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . )","0"
economic," People have different skills , talents , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others .","0"
economic," 4323 . John Maynard Keynes ( 1883–1946 ) , one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century , pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking .","0"
economic," Keynes , shown in [ link ] , famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist ’s book : “ [ Economics ] is a method rather than a doctrine , an apparatus of the mind , a technique of thinking , which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions . ” In other words , economics teaches you how to think , not what to think .","0"
economic," 4332 . In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .","0"
economic," Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .","1"
economic," Businesses supply goods and services based on demand .","0"
economic," 4335 . It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013 , according to an entity known as The World Bank .","0"
economic," Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .","1"
economic," Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .","1"
economic," 4338 . Burgers cost $ 2 each , and bus tickets are 50 cents each .","0"
economic," [ link ] shows Alphonso ’s budget constraint , that is , the outer boundary of his opportunity set .","1"
economic," The opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget .","1"
economic," 4344 . These decisions do not look back to past choices .","0"
economic," Thus , the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs , which are costs that were incurred in the past and can not be recovered , should not affect the current decision .","1"
economic," 4350 . Productive efficiency means that , given the available inputs and technology , it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good .","1"
economic," All choices on the PPF in [ link ] , including A , B , C , D , and F , display productive efficiency .","0"
economic," 4353 . When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country , we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good .","1"
economic," In our example , Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat .","0"
economic," 4356 . The first theme is scarcity .","0"
economic," It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods .","0"
economic," 4362 . Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied .","0"
economic," Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .","1"
economic," The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .","1"
economic," 4365 . The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .","1"
economic," An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .","1"
economic," Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .","1"
economic," 4368 . Then , those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand : Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Therefore , the elasticity of demand from G to H 1.47 .","0"
economic," The magnitude of the elasticity has increased ( in absolute value ) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B .","0"
economic," Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .","0"
economic," 4371 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .","1"
economic," In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," While perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic , goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves .","0"
economic," 4374 . However , in some cases , the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise .","0"
economic," For example , many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil .","0"
economic," Coffee shops use coffee as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price of coffee .","0"
economic," 4377 . However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .","0"
economic," When the income elasticity of demand is negative , the good is called an inferior good . The concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in Demand and Supply .","1"
economic," A higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good , which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive .","1"
economic," 4380 . In markets for financial capital , the elasticity of savings — that is , the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates — will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital .","1"
economic," That is :","0"
economic," 4383 . Private enterprise , the ownership of businesses by private individuals , is a hallmark of the U.S. economy .","1"
economic," When people think of businesses , often giants like Wal - Mart , Microsoft , or General Motors come to mind .","0"
economic," 4386 . These two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit , accounting profit and economic profit .","0"
economic," Accounting profit is a cash concept .","0"
economic," It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .","1"
economic," 4389 . However , the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns .","0"
economic," When a firm looks at its total costs of production in the short run , a useful starting point is to divide total costs into two categories : fixed costs that can not be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed . Fixed and Variable Costs","0"
economic," 4392 . At some point , you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other ’s way .","0"
economic," In this case , the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease , as shown in the last row of [ link ] .","0"
economic," This pattern of diminishing marginal returns is common in production .","0"
economic," As another example , consider the problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer ’s field .","0"
economic," 4395 . Marginal cost is somewhat different .","0"
economic," Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output .","1"
economic," So it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced , but only the next one ( or next few ) .","0"
economic," 4401 . This pattern was illustrated earlier in [ link].In the middle portion of the long - run average cost curve , the flat portion of the curve around Q3 , economies of scale have been exhausted .","0"
economic," In this situation , allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production , and it is called constant returns to scale .","0"
economic," In this range of the LRAC curve , the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls .","0"
economic," 4407 . When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up , for example , people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands , commuting by carpool or mass transit , or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home .","0"
economic," Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand .","1"
economic," The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .","0"
economic," 4410 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .","1"
economic," Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .","1"
economic," 4413 . When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .","0"
economic," Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied — that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied — the law of supply .","1"
economic," The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .","0"
economic," 4416 . Remember this : When two lines on a diagram cross , this intersection usually means something .","0"
economic," The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .","1"
economic," The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) .","1"
economic," 4419 . In fact , at any above - equilibrium price , the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded .","1"
economic," We call this an excess supply or a surplus .","0"
economic," 4422 . A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables : quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis .","0"
economic," The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .","0"
economic," 4425 . They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home , and so on .","0"
economic," A product whose demand falls when income rises , and vice versa , is called an inferior good .","1"
economic," In other words , when income increases , the demand curve shifts to the left .","0"
economic," 4428 . Other goods are complements for each other , meaning that the goods are often used together , because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other .","1"
economic," Examples include breakfast cereal and milk ; notebooks and pens or pencils , golf balls and golf clubs ; gasoline and sport utility vehicles ; and the five - way combination of bacon , lettuce , tomato , mayonnaise , and bread .","0"
economic," 4431 . In thinking about the factors that affect supply , remember what motivates firms : profits , which are the difference between revenues and costs .","1"
economic," Goods and services are produced using combinations of labor , materials , and machinery , or what we call inputs or factors of production .","1"
economic," If a firm faces lower costs of production , while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged , a firm ’s profits go up .","0"
economic," 4434 . How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events ?","0"
economic," The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption .","0"
economic," Look at how each economic event affects each market , one event at a time , holding all else constant .","1"
economic," 4437 . Price controls come in two flavors .","0"
economic," A price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level ( the “ ceiling ” ) , while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level ( the “ floor ” ) .","1"
economic," This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings .","0"
economic," 4440 . If nurses ’ salaries in Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington are higher than in other cities , more nurses will move to Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington to find jobs , more people will be willing to train as nurses , and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full - time job .","0"
economic," In other words , there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area . At equilibrium , the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal .","1"
economic," Thus , every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker , and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job .","0"
economic," 4443 . The labor market , however , presents some prominent examples of price floors , which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low - paid workers .","0"
economic," The U.S. government sets a minimum wage , a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate .","1"
economic," In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .","0"
economic," 4449 . Many states do have usury laws , which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge .","1"
economic," However , in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate .","0"
economic," 4452 . Information on the consumption choices of Americans is available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .","1"
economic," [ link ] shows spending patterns for the average U.S. household .","0"
economic," 4455 . José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility , which is the term economists use to describe a person ’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices . Let ’s begin with an assumption , which will be discussed in more detail later , that José can measure his own utility with something called utils .","1"
economic," ( It is important to note that you can not make comparisons between the utils of individuals ; if one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils , this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much . )","0"
economic," 4458 . Another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar .","0"
economic," Marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility José receives given the price of the product .","1"
economic," For José ’s T - shirts and movies , the marginal utility per dollar is shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," 4461 . Let ’s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices .","0"
economic," [ link ] shows a budget constraint that represents Kimberly ’s choice between concert tickets at $ 50 each and getting away overnight to a bed - and - breakfast for $ 200 per night .","0"
economic," Kimberly has $ 1,000 per year to spend between these two choices .","0"
economic," 4464 . A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .","0"
economic," Goods where demand declines as income rises ( or conversely , where the demand rises as income falls ) are called “ inferior goods . ” An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises , because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer .","1"
economic," For example , a higher - income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car , and instead eat more steak and buy a new car .","0"
economic," 4470 . Rates of saving in America have never been especially high , but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years , as the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in [ link ] show .","0"
economic," A decision about how much to save can be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint .","0"
economic," Household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor - leisure decision .","0"
economic," 4473 . This insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with a higher rate of return .","0"
economic," For example , Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) and 401(k ) accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later , after retirement .","1"
economic," The main difference between these accounts is that an IRA is usually set up by an individual , while a 401(k ) needs to be set up through an employer .","0"
economic," 4476 . Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting , or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values .","1"
economic," Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible , or having equal value to the individual , regardless of the situation .","0"
economic," You might , for instance , think of the $ 25 you found in the street differently from the $ 25 you earned from three hours working in a fast food restaurant .","0"
economic," 4479 . A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker , because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market .","1"
economic," If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny , it will lose all of its sales to competitors .","0"
economic," 4482 . [ link ] presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [ link ] .","0"
economic," The marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit .","1"
economic," As mentioned before , a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product — that is , the firm ’s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level .","0"
economic," 4485 . But in the long run , firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output , and some firms will cease production altogether .","0"
economic," The long - run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit .","1"
economic," The following Clear It Up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from , and the reasons why some firms go out of business . Why do firms cease to exist ?","0"
economic," 4488 . For a constant cost industry , whenever there is an increase in market demand and price , then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms ’ entry and stops at the point where the new long - run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before .","1"
economic," But why will costs remain the same ?","0"
economic," 4491 . When profit - maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility - maximizing consumers , something remarkable happens : the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency ( terms that were first introduced in ( Choice in a World of Scarcity ) .","0"
economic," Productive efficiency means producing without waste , so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier .","1"
economic," In the long run in a perfectly competitive market , because of the process of entry and exit , the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .","0"
economic," 4494 . These profits should attract vigorous competition as described in Perfect Competition , and yet , because of one particular characteristic of monopoly , they do not .","0"
economic," Barriers to entry are the legal , technological , or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market .","1"
economic," Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable , such as the cost of renting retail space , to the extremely restrictive .","0"
economic," 4497 . Economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition .","0"
economic," ( This theme was introduced in Cost and Industry Structure ) .","0"

economic," Copyright Office , “ is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States for ‘ original works of authorship ’ including literary , dramatic , musical , architectural , cartographic , choreographic , pantomimic , pictorial , graphic , sculptural , and audiovisual creations . ” No one can reproduce , display , or perform a copyrighted work without permission of the author .","1"
economic," 4503 . AT&T lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission , so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism .","0"
economic," The same thing happened to local service , especially in recent years , with the growth in cellular phone systems . The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation , starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1990s .","0"
economic," This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter , the prices that could be charged , and the quantities that could be produced in many industries , including telecommunications , airlines , trucking , banking , and electricity .","0"
economic," 4506 . But a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs , because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience .","0"
economic," A monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit - maximizing combination of quantity and price .","1"
economic," 4509 . Allocative efficiency is a social concept .","0"
economic," It refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output , the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost .","1"
economic," 4512 . One type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic competition .","0"
economic," Monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms , but the products that they sell are not identical .","1"
economic," 4515 . A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways : physical aspects of the product , location from which the product is sold , intangible aspects of the product , and perceptions of the product .","1"
economic," Products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called differentiated products .","0"
economic," 4518 . As an example of a profit - maximizing monopolistic competitor , consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store , which serves pizza with cheese , sweet and sour sauce , and your choice of vegetables and meats .","0"
economic," Although Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants , it has a differentiated product .","0"
economic," 4521 . As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .","0"
economic," The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .","1"
economic," When price is equal to average cost , economic profits are zero .","0"
economic," 4524 . Critics of market - oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles .","0"
economic," They argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation , and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation , is socially wasteful — that is , most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price .","0"
economic," Defenders of a market - oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names , no one is forcing them to do so .","0"
economic," 4527 . Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve — which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms ( and they need not produce differentiated products ) .","0"
economic," Again , smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete , while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price .","0"
economic," 4530 . In the United States , as well as many other countries , it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti - competitive behavior , which is a violation of antitrust law .","0"
economic," Both the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States .","0"
economic," 4533 . The prisoner ’s dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing self - interest .","1"
economic," It applies well to oligopoly .","0"
economic," 4536 . If a group of U.S. companies signed such a contract , however , it would be illegal .","0"
economic," Certain international organizations , like the nations that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly , hold down output , and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports .","0"
economic," Such agreements , however , because they fall in a gray area of international law , are not legally enforceable .","0"
economic," 4539 . Thus , if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel , but do not match price increases , then none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices , since the potential gains are minimal .","0"
economic," This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation , in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output , increase price , and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement .","0"
economic," 4542 . The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers , and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones , are called antitrust laws .","1"
economic," Before a large merger happens , the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger , prohibit it , or allow it if certain conditions are met .","0"
economic," 4545 . Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .","1"
economic," In 1950 , the Celler - Kefauver Act extended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers .","0"
economic," In the twenty - first century , the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws .","0"
economic," 4548 . Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index ( HHI ) .","0"
economic," The HHI , as it is often called , is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry , as the following Work it Out shows .","1"
economic," 4551 . For more on the difficulties of defining markets , refer to Monopoly . This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies , instead of defining a market and counting up total sales .","0"
economic," A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real - world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are proposing the merger .","0"
economic," A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry .","0"
economic," 4554 . An exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal .","0"
economic," It is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers .","0"
economic," 4557 . Computer software manufacturers may often bundle together a number of different programs , even when the buyer wants only a few of the programs .","0"
economic," Think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase , for example . Recall from the chapter on Monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm ( or firms ) reacts to a new firm by dropping prices very low , until the new firm is driven out of the market , at which point the existing firm raises prices again .","0"
economic," This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market .","0"
economic," 4560 . So what then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly ?","0"
economic," [ link ] illustrates the case of natural monopoly , with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve .","0"
economic," Points A , B , C , and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation .","0"
economic," 4563 . Thus , in the 1980s and 1990s , some regulators of public utilities began to use price cap regulation , where the regulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years .","1"
economic," A common pattern was to require a price that declined slightly over time .","0"
economic," 4566 . A number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron , Tyco International , and WorldCom led to the Sarbanes - Oxley Act in 2002 .","0"
economic," Sarbanes - Oxley was designed to increase confidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud .","1"
economic," 4569 . In this case , the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange , but you have no voice in their market transaction .","0"
economic," The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .","1"
economic," Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .","0"
economic," 4572 . If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .","0"
economic," If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .","0"
economic," 4575 . Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .","0"
economic," If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .","0"
economic," 4578 . In 1970 , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) was created to oversee all environmental laws .","1"
economic," In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .","1"
economic," Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .","0"
economic," 4581 . [ link ] illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution .","0"
economic," The marginal cost of pollution reduction , like most most marginal cost curves increases with output , at least in the short run .","0"
economic," Reducing the first 10 pounds of particulate emissions costs the firm $ 300 .","0"
economic," 4584 . Coase pointed out that this issue can not be resolved until property rights are clearly defined — that is , the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation .","1"
economic," Does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned ?","0"
economic," 4587 . [ link ] illustrates a theoretical model of this situation .","0"
economic," When the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive — for example , at quantity Qa — there are usually a lot of relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution , and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high .","0"
economic," At Qa , it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution .","0"
economic," 4590 . Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world .","0"
economic," Global warming and biodiversity are examples of international externalities . Bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities .","0"
economic," If nations such as China , India , Brazil , Mexico , and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats , then the world ’s high - income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases .","0"
economic," 4593 . Economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P , Q , R , S and T in [ link ] , all of which lie along the production possibility frontier .","0"
economic," Countries with low per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) , such as China , place a greater emphasis on economic output — which in turn helps to produce nutrition , shelter , health , education , and desirable consumer goods .","0"
economic," Countries with higher income levels , where a greater share of people have access to the basic necessities of life , may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection .","0"
economic," 4596 . Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want .","0"
economic," As Gregory Lee , CEO of Samsung said , “ Relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology . ” An innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above - normal profits before competitors can catch up .","0"
economic," 4599 . If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .","0"
economic," However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .","0"
economic," The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .","1"
economic," 4602 . The social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug .","1"
economic," If Big Drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies , its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve DSocial , and it would be willing to borrow and invest $ 52 million .","0"
economic," However , if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits , the firm will not spend as much on creating new products .","0"
economic," 4605 . After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .","0"
economic," While not always easy to measure , according to Walter McMahon , the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population , lower levels of crime , a cleaner environment and a more stable , democratic government .","1"
economic," For these reasons , many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary , secondary , and higher education .","0"
economic," 4608 . State and federal governments support research in a variety of ways .","0"
economic," For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ” The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical - related research spending $ 117 billion in 2011 .","1"
economic," Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .","0"
economic," 4611 . What about a situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit ?","1"
economic," This kind of good is called a public good .","0"
economic," Spending on national defense is a good example of a public good .","0"
economic," 4614 . When individuals make decisions about buying a public good , a free rider problem can arise , in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to “ free ride ” on the purchases of others .","1"
economic," The free rider problem can be expressed in terms of the prisoner ’s dilemma game , which is discussed as a representation of oligopoly in Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly .","0"
economic," 4617 . Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .","0"
economic," Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .","1"
economic," 4620 . In the United States , the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person : Mollie Orshansky .","0"
economic," In 1963 , Orshansky , who was working for the Social Security Administration , published an article called “ Children of the Poor ” in a highly useful and dry - as - dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin .","0"
economic," 4623 . As a result , the person experiences no net gain for working .","0"
economic," Economists call this problem the poverty trap .","0"
economic," 4626 . The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor .","1"
economic," Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .","0"
economic," 4629 . From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States ’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .","1"
economic," This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .","0"
economic," 4632 . Often called “ food stamps , ” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is a federally funded program , started in 1964 , in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food .","1"
economic," The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income , number of children , and other factors but , in general , households are expected to spend about 30 % of their own net income on food , and if 30 % of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet , then those households are eligible for SNAP .","0"
economic," SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap .","0"
economic," 4635 . Medicaid was created by Congress in 1965 and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government .","1"
economic," The federal government helps fund Medicaid , but each state is responsible for administering the program , determining the level of benefits , and determining eligibility .","0"
economic," 4638 . For example , you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution .","0"
economic," [ link ] presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a Lorenz curve .","0"
economic," The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis .","1"
economic," 4644 . Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that , even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools , each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests , desires , talents , and efforts .","0"
economic," Some of those initiatives include those shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," 4647 . A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .","1"
economic," Thus , negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining . The subject of labor unions can be controversial .","1"
economic," Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers ’ primary line of defense against efforts by profit - seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits .","0"
economic," 4650 . Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record - keeping and computer - operated cabs for loading and unloading ships — changes which the union opposed , along with overtime pay .","0"
economic," President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 — commonly known as the Taft - Hartley Act — where a court can impose an 80 - day “ cooling - off period ” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage .","1"
economic," Federal mediators were called in , and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015 .","0"
economic," 4653 . The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions .","0"
economic," The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor - Management Relations Act of 1935 , which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so .","1"
economic," The U.S. government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all - out production efforts needed during World War II .","0"
economic," 4656 . Investigating the Black / White Earnings GapBlacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century .","0"
economic," Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker , regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker .","0"
economic," Moreover , blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities , which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs .","0"
economic," 4659 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .","1"
economic," The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .","1"
economic," The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .","1"
economic," 4662 . Today , affirmative action policies are applied only to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit .","0"

economic," This was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) or as the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but was more popularly known as Obamacare .","0"
economic," The bill ’s opponents ’ claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $ 750 billion to the deficit , to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so - called “ death panels ” that decide which critically - ill patients receive care and which do not .","0"
economic," 4668 . Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .","1"
economic," Let ’s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods , labor , and financial capital markets .","0"
economic," The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold .","0"
economic," 4671 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .","1"
economic," By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .","1"
economic," When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating , markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price .","0"
economic," 4674 . “ If only you knew more economics , you would not be so irrational , ” is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying .","0"
economic," A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion , because so much of this so - called “ quirky ” behavior is extremely common among us .","0"
economic," For example , a conventional economist would say that if you lost a $ 10 bill today , and also got an extra $ 10 in your paycheck , you should feel perfectly neutral .","0"
economic," 4677 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .","1"
economic," The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .","1"
economic," Service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars , appliances and even houses .","0"
economic," 4680 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .","0"
economic," Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .","1"
economic," 4683 . Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .","1"
economic," Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .","1"
economic," 4686 . Unemployment insurance : Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance , which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time , usually six months , after they lose their jobs .","1"
economic," 4689 . Workman ’s compensation insurance : Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds , typically run at the state level , that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job .","1"
economic," 4692 . Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance .","1"
economic," For example , if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor , you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor ’s visit .","0"
economic," 4695 . Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .","1"
economic," Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .","1"
economic," For example , insurance might pay for 80 % of the costs of repairing a home after a fire , but the homeowner would pay the other 20 % .","0"
economic," 4698 . Adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high - risk or low - risk than the insurance company does .","1"
economic," This creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high - risk tend to want to buy more insurance , without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk .","0"
economic," 4701 . In March of 2010 , President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) .","0"
economic," This highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013 .","0"
economic," 4704 . Individuals can not , however , take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year , write a letter to General Motors or some other firm , and negotiate to invest their money with that firm .","0"
economic," Financial capital markets bridge this gap : that is , they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital .","1"
economic," Such financial markets include stocks , bonds , bank loans , and other financial investments .","0"
economic," 4707 . They also provide advice on potential products , customers , and key employees .","0"
economic," Typically , a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms , and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs . The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year : as one example , venture capital firms invested more than $ 48.3 billion in 2014 , according to the National Venture Capital Association .","1"
economic," All early - stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big ; indeed , many of them will go out of business within a few months or years .","0"
economic," 4710 . A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .","1"
economic," For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury .","1"
economic," 4713 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .","0"
economic," Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .","1"
economic," 4716 . First , a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public ( the public includes individuals , mutual funds , insurance companies , and pension funds ) .","0"
economic," A firm ’s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering ( IPO ) .","1"
economic," The IPO is important for two reasons .","0"
economic," 4719 . A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .","1"
economic," A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .","1"
economic," 4722 . Accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance , the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives , fails , as the following Clear It Up feature on Lehman Brothers shows . How did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure ?","1"
economic," 4725 . It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .","0"
economic," Risk measures the uncertainty of that project ’s profitability .","1"
economic," There are several types of risk , including default risk and interest rate risk .","0"
economic," 4728 . Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs .","0"
economic," A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .","1"
economic," A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .","1"
economic," 4731 . In part , this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer .","0"
economic," In addition , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) protects the savings of the average person .","1"
economic," Every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC , based on the size of its deposits .","0"
economic," 4734 . This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .","0"
economic," The bond has a coupon rate or interest rate , which is usually semi - annual , but can be paid at different times throughout the year .","0"
economic," ( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . )","0"
economic," 4737 . The bond yield measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time .","1"
economic," Bonds are bought not only when they are issued ; they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes .","0"
economic," 4740 . An individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions .","0"
economic," Thus , a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification , which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies .","1"
economic," A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb : “ Do n’t put all your eggs in one basket . ” In any broad group of companies , some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse — but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value .","0"
economic," 4743 . About two - thirds of U.S. households own their own home .","0"
economic," An owner ’s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house .","0"
economic," For example , imagine that you buy a house for $ 200,000 , paying 10 % of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $ 180,000 .","0"
economic," 4746 . Compound interest is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest .","1"
economic," 4749 . In 2002 , Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) .","0"
economic," The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns .","0"
economic," 4752 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .","0"
economic," In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .","0"
economic," 4755 . The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high , while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower .","0"
economic," One reason might be that senior citizens are represented by AARP , a well - funded and well - organized lobbying group , while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance .","0"
economic," 4758 . For example , policies that impose price controls — like rent control — may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords .","0"
economic," However , when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area , a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available .","0"
economic," 4761 . Democracy is sometimes summed up ( and oversimplified ) in two words : “ Majority rule . ”","1"
economic," When voters face three or more choices , however , then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers .","0"
economic," 4764 . The situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B , Choice B is preferred by a majority over Choice C , and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A is called a voting cycle .","1"
economic," It is easy to imagine sets of government choices — say , perhaps the choice between increased defense spending , increased government spending on health care , and a tax cut — in which a voting cycle could occur .","0"
economic," 4767 . In April 2009 , the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , asking it to investigate tire imports from China .","0"
economic," Under U.S. trade law , if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States , as determined by the ITC , then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption .","0"
economic," 4770 . Who buys all of this production ?","0"
economic," This demand can be divided into four main parts : consumer spending ( consumption ) , business spending ( investment ) , government spending on goods and services , and spending on net exports .","1"
economic," ( See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what is meant by investment . )","0"
economic," 4773 . The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports ( X ) minus the dollar value of imports ( M ) , ( X – M ) .","1"
economic," The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .","1"
economic," If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus .","1"
economic," 4776 . Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid- 2000s .","0"
economic," [ link ] ( b ) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades , even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009 .","0"
economic," As noted before , if exports and imports are equal , foreign trade has no effect on total GDP .","0"
economic," 4779 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .","0"
economic," Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations .","1"
economic," 4782 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .","1"
economic," The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .","1"
economic," 4785 . Similarly , if you do not know the rate of inflation , it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced .","0"
economic," The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .","1"
economic," The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .","1"
economic," 4788 . [ link ] shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960 .","0"
economic," Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .","0"
economic," 4791 . A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .","1"
economic," An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .","1"
economic," The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008 – 2009 .","0"
economic," 4794 . Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .","0"
economic," The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle .","1"
economic," It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough - to - peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960 .","0"
economic," 4797 . Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .","1"
economic," Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose , market exchange rates and purchasing power parity ( PPP ) equivalent exchange rates .","0"
economic," Market exchange rates vary on a day - to - day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets .","1"
economic," 4800 . One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that , as of 1970 , only about 42 % of women participated in the paid labor force .","0"
economic," By the second decade of the 2000s , nearly 60 % of women participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .","0"
economic," As women are now in the labor force , many of the services they used to produce in the non - market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy , which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed .","0"
economic," 4803 . Before the last two centuries , although rulers , nobles , and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level , the average person ’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries .","0"
economic," Progressive , powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .","0"
economic," According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .","0"
economic," The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .","1"
economic," 4806 . Economic growth depends on many factors .","0"
economic," Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country ’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently .","0"
economic," Laws must be clear , public , fair , enforced , and equally applicable to all members of society .","0"
economic," 4809 . The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change .","0"
economic," Technological change is a combination of invention — advances in knowledge — and innovation , which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service .","1"
economic," For example , the transistor was invented in 1947 .","0"
economic," 4812 . While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 ( around 3 % ) , it has slowed down since then .","0"
economic," Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages .","0"
economic," Over time , the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce .","0"
economic," 4815 . The category of technology is the “ joker in the deck . ”","0"
economic," Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation .","0"
economic," When most people think of new technology , the invention of new products like the laser , the smartphone , or some new wonder drug come to mind .","0"
economic," 4818 . When society increases the level of capital per person , the result is called capital deepening .","1"
economic," The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker .","0"
economic," 4821 . Some low - income and middle - income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence , in which their economies grow faster than those of high - income countries .","0"
economic," GDP increased by an average rate of 2.7 % per year in the 1990s and 2.3 % per year from 2000 to 2008 in the high - income countries of the world , which include the United States , Canada , the countries of the European Union , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .","0"
economic," 4824 . How did these incomes increase ?","0"
economic," The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital .","1"
economic," Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence .","0"
economic," 4827 . There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed , though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be .","0"
economic," Additionally , there are individuals who are underemployed .","0"
economic," This includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills .","0"

economic," 4833 . One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy .","0"
economic," If firms believe that business is expanding , then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor , and the labor demand curve shifts to the right .","0"
economic," 4836 . In other words , these people are involuntarily unemployed .","0"
economic," What causes involuntary unemployment ?","0"
economic," 4839 . One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract , which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble , and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong .","0"
economic," This wage - setting behavior acts like a form of insurance : the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times , but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times .","0"
economic," 4842 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ”","1"
economic," A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .","0"
economic," However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .","1"
economic," 4845 . In a market economy , some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons : old technology ; poor management ; good management that happened to make bad decisions ; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm ’s product is desired ; a large customer who went broke ; or tough domestic or foreign competitors .","0"
economic," Conversely , other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees .","0"
economic," 4848 . However , adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly .","0"
economic," Wages are typically reviewed only once or twice a year .","0"
economic," In many modern jobs , it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level .","0"
economic," 4851 . Sure , the average worker in 2014 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970 — but not six times more productive .","0"
economic," Sure , per capita GDP increased substantially from 1970 to 2014 , but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eight times better off in just 44 years ?","0"
economic," Not likely .","0"
economic," A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand .","0"
economic," 4854 . To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods , the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number , rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods .","0"
economic," Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .","1"
economic," 4857 . The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .","0"
economic," In recent years , the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem : that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living , because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility .","0"
economic," 4860 . As we ’ve learned , CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending .","1"
economic," Well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables .","1"
economic," In this way , economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living .","0"
economic," 4863 . There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .","1"
economic," An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .","1"
economic," The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .","1"
economic," 4866 . Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower , as in the recession of 1920 – 1921 , the Great Depression , the recession of 1980 – 1982 , and the Great Recession in 2008 – 2009 .","0"
economic," There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary , but not at an annual rate .","0"
economic," 4869 . What are the economic problems caused by inflation , and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public ?","0"
economic," Consider a very short story : “ The Land of Funny Money . ”","0"
economic," 4872 . The problem of a good - looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ugly - looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes .","0"
economic," The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms , without an adjustment for inflation .","0"
economic," 4875 . The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles .","0"
economic," These plans are tax deferred , and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer , their 401(k ) comes with them .","0"
economic," To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return , retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners . However , ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation .","0"
economic," 4878 . Inflation can make long - term planning difficult .","0"
economic," In discussing unintended redistributions , we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation .","0"
economic," Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement , because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty .","0"
economic," 4881 . An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .","1"
economic," A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs .","0"
economic," Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another — say , increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive — indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation .","0"
economic," 4884 . The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing .","0"
economic," Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972 , the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index .","0"
economic," Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount — $ 117,000 in 2014 .","1"
economic," 4887 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .","1"
economic," Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .","1"
economic," If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .","1"
economic," 4890 . A few decades ago , it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes , trains , and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade .","1"
economic," This measurement is called the merchandise trade balance .","0"
economic," In most high - income economies , including the United States , goods make up less than half of a country ’s total production , while services compose more than half .","0"
economic," 4893 . Statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) within the U.S. Department of Commerce , using a variety of different sources .","0"
economic," 4896 . The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers , which are payments made by government , private charities , or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received .","1"
economic," Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category , as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities .","0"
economic," 4899 . The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage , which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter .","0"

economic," 4902 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .","0"
economic," In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .","0"
economic," 4905 . When the trade deficit rises , it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital .","0"
economic," The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways .","0"
economic," 4908 . A nation ’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade , but these two are actually quite separate .","0"
economic," It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade — measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP — while it also has a near - balance between exports and imports .","0"
economic," A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation ’s production is exported .","1"
economic," 4911 . The next three chapters take up this task .","0"
economic," This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium .","0"
economic," This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals .","1"
economic," 4914 . The bottom line remains , however , that every sale represents income to someone , and so , Say ’s law argues , a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy .","1"
economic," Because Jean - Baptiste Say , Adam Smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists .","1"
economic," If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as Say himself recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur .","0"
economic," To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .","0"
economic," 4917 . The alternative to Say ’s law , with its emphasis on supply , can be named Keynes ’ law : “ Demand creates its own supply . ”","1"
economic," As a matter of historical accuracy , just as Jean - Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say ’s law , John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes ’ law , but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view .","0"
economic," When Keynes wrote his great work The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money during the Great Depression of the 1930s , he pointed out that during the Depression , the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much .","0"
economic," U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20 % from 1933 to 1935 , but the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much .","0"
economic," 4920 . real GDP ) firms will produce and sell .","0"
economic," The aggregate supply ( AS ) curve shows the total quantity of output ( i.e . real GDP ) that firms will produce and sell at each price level .","1"
economic," [ link ] shows an aggregate supply curve .","0"
economic," 4923 . Aggregate demand ( AD ) refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy .","1"
economic," ( Strictly speaking , AD is what economists call total planned expenditure .","0"
economic," 4926 . U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .","0"
economic," U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .","0"
economic," Thus , a higher domestic price level , relative to price levels in other countries , will reduce net export expenditures .","0"
economic," 4929 . In the long run , the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth .","0"
economic," Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .","1"
economic," 4932 . When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy , they tend to consume more .","1"
economic," If business confidence is high , then firms tend to spend more on investment , believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial .","0"
economic," Conversely , if consumer or business confidence drops , then consumption and investment spending decline .","0"
economic," 4935 . During a recession , when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses , the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts .","0"
economic," During the recession of 2001 , for example , a tax cut was enacted into law .","0"
economic," 4938 . In many of the national economies across Europe , the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10 % or a bit lower , even in good economic years .","0"
economic," This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year - in and year - out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market .","1"
economic," Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies , depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy .","1"
economic," 4941 . Now , focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve , which is the near - vertical portion on the right - hand side .","0"
economic," If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP , then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy .","0"
economic," 4944 . Because AD is volatile , it can easily fall .","0"
economic," Thus , even if we start at Yp , if AD falls , then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap .","0"
economic," The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .","0"
economic," 4947 . Nondurable goods are things like groceries — once you consume them , they are gone .","1"
economic," Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy , like healthcare or entertainment . Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption :","0"
economic," 4950 . Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes , so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items .","0"
economic," The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate .","0"
economic," Even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital .","1"
economic," 4953 . First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .","0"
economic," Second , the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand .","1"
economic," We will consider these two claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the AD / AS model . The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed .","1"
economic," 4956 . In fact , if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality , where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level .","1"
economic," For example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales .","0"
economic," 4959 . In the 1950s , A.W .","0"
economic," Phillips , an economist at the London School of Economics , was studying the Keynesian analytical framework .","0"
economic," 4962 . The second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation .","0"
economic," In other words , there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they realize inflation is occurring , the tradeoff disappears .","0"
economic," Both factors ( supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the Phillips curve , to shift .","0"
economic," 4965 . In this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern .","0"
economic," The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left .","0"
economic," The result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment .","0"
economic," 4968 . The key policy implication is this : Should the government focus more on long - term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment ?","0"
economic," This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .","0"
economic," Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run","0"
economic," 4971 . Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .","0"
economic," Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done .","1"
economic," Compare , for example , your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software .","0"
economic," 4974 . Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical .","0"
economic," In response to those immortal words of John Maynard Keynes , “ In the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as , say , ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy .","0"
economic," 4977 . Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work .","1"
economic," Is that the likely outcome?Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all enacted in a timely fashion .","1"
economic," After all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later .","0"
economic," 4980 . The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation .","0"
economic," The great economist Milton Friedman ( 1912 – 2006 ) summed up the neoclassical view of the long - term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech : “ [ T ] here is always a temporary trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ”","0"
economic," 4983 . If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model , in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures .","0"
economic," [ link ] shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand , rising from AD0 to AD1 to AD2 .","0"
economic," 4986 . Instead , many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives .","0"
economic," Robert Solow , the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987 , described the dual approach in this way :","0"
economic," 4989 . Economies without money typically engage in the barter system .","0"
economic," Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .","1"
economic," In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .","1"
economic," 4992 . Second , money must serve as a store of value .","0"
economic," In a barter system , we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services .","0"
economic," 4995 . Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future .","1"
economic," So money serves all of these functions — it is a medium of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of deferred payment .","1"
economic," 4998 . As economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome .","0"
economic," Countries moved towards the use of fiat money .","0"
economic," Fiat money has no intrinsic value , but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country .","1"
economic," 5001 . There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .","0"
economic," M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds .","1"
economic," M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .","0"
economic," Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .","0"
economic," 5004 . For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .","1"
economic," Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .","1"
economic," Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .","1"
economic," 5007 . It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .","0"
economic," Although you can make a purchase with a credit card , it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you .","0"
economic," When you make a purchase with a credit card , the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller , and at the end of the month , the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month .","0"
economic," 5010 . Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets .","1"
economic," Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .","0"
economic," 5013 . Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .","1"
economic," Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .","1"
economic," All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool , which is then loaned out .","0"
economic," 5016 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .","1"
economic," An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .","1"
economic," For example , the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition .","0"
economic," 5019 . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .","0"
economic," A bank ’s net worth is also referred to as bank capital .","1"
economic," A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults , monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank ( called “ reserves ” ) , loans that are made to customers , and bonds .","1"
economic," 5022 . The second category of bank asset is bonds , which are a common mechanism for borrowing , used by the federal and local government , and also private companies , and nonprofit organizations .","1"
economic," A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds — typically bonds issued by the U.S. government .","0"
economic," 5025 . The bank will be more willing to make what are called “ subprime loans , ” which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down - payment , little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income , and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that .","1"
economic," Some subprime loans made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans : loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income , No Job , or Assets .","0"
economic," These subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities — but with a twist .","0"
economic," The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage - backed securities , certain investors would agree to take the first , say , 5 % of such losses .","0"
economic," 5028 . Fortunately , a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system .","0"
economic," The money multiplier formula is :","0"
economic," 5031 . Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England .","0"
economic," In the United States , the central bank is called the Federal Reserve — often abbreviated as just “ the Fed . ” This section explains the organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank .","1"
economic," 5034 . Bank regulation is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk .","1"
economic," Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .","0"
economic," 5037 . They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .","1"
economic," In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .","0"
economic," A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities .","0"
economic," 5040 . In this situation , whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money , and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough , lost their money .","0"
economic," Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run .","1"
economic," In the movie It ’s a Wonderful Life , the bank manager , played by Jimmy Stewart , faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money , but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon .","0"
economic," 5043 . To prevent this , the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from anywhere else .","1"
economic," This is known as the lender of last resort role .","0"
economic," For banks , the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money .","0"
economic," 5046 . The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations .","1"
economic," The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors .","0"
economic," 5049 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .","1"
economic," If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .","0"
economic," If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves , they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out .","0"
economic," 5052 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .","1"
economic," Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .","1"
economic," This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand , and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation .","0"
economic," 5055 . If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment , with output below potential GDP , expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP .","0"
economic," [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .","0"
economic," 5058 . [ link ] shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades .","0"
economic," The graph shows the federal funds interest rate ( remember , this interest rate is set through open market operations ) , the unemployment rate , and the inflation rate since 1975 .","0"
economic," Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure .","0"
economic," 5061 . Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways .","0"
economic," First , it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills .","1"
economic," In 2008 , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get .","0"
economic," 5064 . If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level , the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans .","0"
economic," Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms ’ sales and employees ’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .","0"
economic," The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .","0"
economic," 5067 . Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used .","0"
economic," Consider the velocity of M1 , the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances .","0"
economic," In 2009 , for example , M1 was $ 1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $ 14.3 trillion , so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ( $ 14.3 trillion / $ 1.7 trillion ) .","0"
economic," 5070 . This equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but , as you can see , it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form .","0"
economic," This equation must hold true , by definition .","0"
economic," 5073 . In the 1970s , when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable , a number of economists , led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman ( 1912 – 2006 ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate .","0"
economic," These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy , and the political pressures on central bankers , central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects .","0"
economic," 5076 . This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low .","1"
economic," By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .","0"
economic," 5079 . One long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future .","0"
economic," For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .","1"
economic," The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .","0"
economic," 5082 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .","1"
economic," Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .","1"
economic," In good economic times , this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth .","0"
economic," 5085 . Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor .","0"
economic," For example , Ecuador , El Salvador , and Panama have decided to dollarize — that is , to use the U.S. dollar as their currency .","1"
economic," Sometimes nations share a common currency .","0"
economic," 5088 . In foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely interrelated , because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice versa .","0"
economic," To get a sense of this , it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) tourists visiting other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership .","0"
economic," Let ’s consider these categories in turn .","0"
economic," 5091 . Let ’s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth , and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is .","0"
economic," You can hedge , which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments ( in this case , currency risk from the contract ) .","1"
economic," Specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time .","0"
economic," 5094 . When the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” For exchange rates , the terminology is different .","0"
economic," When the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies , it is referred to as appreciating or “ strengthening . ” When the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency trades for less of other currencies , it is referred to as depreciating or “ weakening . ”","1"
economic," To illustrate the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980 , shown in [ link ] ( a ) .","0"
economic," The vertical axis in [ link ] ( a ) shows the price of $ 1 in U.S. currency , measured in terms of Canadian currency .","0"
economic," 5097 . In the actual foreign exchange market , almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars .","0"
economic," What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift , thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate ?","0"
economic," The answer to this question is discussed in the following section .","0"
economic," 5100 . The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate . A group of economists at the International Comparison Program , run by the World Bank , have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods .","1"
economic," 5103 . Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency .","0"
economic," As a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole .","0"
economic," 5106 . Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers .","0"
economic," When most of a country ’s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously , a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results .","0"
economic," Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into bankruptcy .","0"
economic," 5109 . In 2013 , there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen ( relative to the U.S. Dollar ) by about 14 % and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14 % .","0"
economic," ( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS ) The line 's variations represent the volatility of exchange rates .","0"
economic," 5112 . A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .","1"
economic," With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .","1"
economic," A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies .","0"
economic," 5115 . Brazil ’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an appreciation .","0"
economic," Alternatively , Brazil ’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market .","0"
economic," 5118 . Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market .","0"
economic," If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .","0"
economic," Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .","0"
economic," 5121 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .","1"
economic," For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .","0"
economic," 5124 . A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency .","1"
economic," A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether .","0"
economic," 5127 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !","0"
economic," Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .","0"
economic," While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .","1"
economic," All government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government .","0"
economic," 5130 . Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .","1"
economic," If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .","1"
economic," For example , in 2009 , the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ 1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes .","0"
economic," 5133 . Together , the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80 % of federal tax revenues in 2014 .","0"
economic," Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly three - quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . The income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases .","1"
economic," Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .","0"
economic," 5136 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .","1"
economic," The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .","1"
economic," 5139 . As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .","0"
economic," The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of gifts .","0"
economic," These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .","0"
economic," 5142 . Graphically , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy .","1"
economic," [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .","0"
economic," 5145 . The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .","0"
economic," Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically , due to automatic stabilizers , such as unemployment insurance and food stamps , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom .","1"
economic," 5148 . Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates .","0"
economic," In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ 800 billion and an interest rate of 6 % .","1"
economic," 5151 . Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time .","0"
economic," The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag .","1"
economic," Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .","0"
economic," 5154 . Also , the government is not a household for many reasons , one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities .","0"
economic," The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the sake of the overall economy .","1"
economic," 5157 . The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal .","0"
economic," However , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit .","0"
economic," For example , in 1999 and 2000 , the U.S. government had budget surpluses , although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits .","0"
economic," 5160 . How will this affect interest rates in financial markets ?","0"
economic," In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) where the demand curve ( D0 ) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve ( S0 ) occurs at an interest rate of 5 % and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20 % of GDP .","0"
economic," However , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1 .","0"
economic," 5163 . If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .","0"
economic," In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment .","0"
economic," On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .","0"
economic," In this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little crowding out of private investment .","0"
economic," However , even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity .","0"
economic," 5166 . The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth - century economist David Ricardo ( 1772 – 1823 ) .","1"
economic," If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving .","0"
economic," 5169 . First , banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros , then convert those U.S. dollars to lira , and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey .","0"
economic," If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates , then Turkey ’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros .","0"
economic," The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession .","0"
economic," Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with Turkey in 2002 , this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995 , Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997 – 1998 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2002 .","0"
economic," 5172 . For example , life expectancy at birth in many low - income regions approximates those who are more affluent .","0"
economic," The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living .","0"
economic," For instance , despite very high income levels , there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America .","0"
economic," 5175 . The world ’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers : South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore .","1"
economic," The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan , although these are often treated under international law as part of China , rather than as separate countries .","0"
economic," 5178 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .","0"
economic," The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .","0"
economic," 5181 . In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .","0"
economic," There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .","0"
economic," In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra - aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution .","0"
economic," However , the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp .","0"
economic," 5184 . Likewise , interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent .","0"
economic," It is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a converging economy ( the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high - income economies .","1"
economic," 5187 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation ’s imports exceed its exports .","0"
economic," In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .","0"
economic," 5190 . It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy , shifting the short - term aggregate supply curve to the left .","0"
economic," The result could be a burst of inflation and , if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession .","0"
economic," People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy , with its great size , is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets .","0"
economic," 5193 . World War I severed many economic connections .","0"
economic," During the Great Depression of the 1930s , many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others .","0"
economic," World War II further hindered international trade .","0"
economic," 5196 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .","0"
economic," The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ”","0"
economic," It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .","0"
economic," 5199 . The United States produces / consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn .","0"
economic," Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .","0"
economic," With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .","0"
economic," 5202 . Then , in the numerical example given , Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators .","0"
economic," Thus , if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes ( giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators ( a gain of 2,500 refrigerators ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade .","0"
economic," Mexico will be unambiguously better off .","0"
economic," 5205 . What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , computers , machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States , the European Union , and Japan ?","0"
economic," There are two reasons : ( 1 ) The division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale .","0"
economic," 5208 . A second broad reason that intra - industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale .","0"
economic," The concept of economies of scale , as introduced in Cost and Industry Structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point .","1"
economic," [ link ] illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens .","0"
economic," 5211 . Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .","1"
economic," Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .","0"
economic," Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .","0"
economic," 5214 . Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services .","0"
economic," They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .","0"
economic," 5217 . ( We ’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter . )","0"
economic," This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world .","0"
economic," It is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules — including rules about tariffs , quotas , and nontariff barriers .","1"
economic," 5220 . There are a number of reasons , but one of them will surprise you : the trade policies of the high - income countries .","0"
economic," Following is a stark review of social priorities which has been widely publicized by the international aid organization , Oxfam International .","0"
economic," 5223 . Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .","0"
economic," Farm subsidies in the high - income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce .","0"
economic," This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production .","0"
economic," 5229 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .","0"
economic," After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .","0"
economic," 5232 . However , Bhutanese politicians , business leaders , and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established , before it needed to face international competition , then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills , management , technology , and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit - earning domestic industry .","0"
economic," Thus , the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time , to give the infant industry time to mature , before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy .","1"
economic," ( Revisit Macroeconomic Policy Around the World for more information on the infant industry argument .","0"
economic," 5235 . Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .","1"
economic," Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .","0"
economic," Anti - dumping complaints have risen in recent years , from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s .","0"
economic," 5238 . In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards .","0"
economic," In contrast , middle- and low - income countries like Brazil , Nigeria , India , and China have lower environmental standards .","0"
economic," The general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury : as soon as their people have enough to eat , decent healthcare , and longer life expectancies , then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants , scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks , national parks to protect wildlife , and so on .","0"
economic," 5241 . The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) was officially born in 1995 , but its history is much longer .","0"
economic," In the years after the Great Depression and World War II , there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together .","0"
economic," 5244 . The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union .","0"
economic," In the years after World War II , leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely , they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war .","0"
economic," 5247 . In other words , the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs ; indeed , the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market change — a new technology — that causes real tradeoffs .","0"
economic," In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade , or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter , the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism , but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues , while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur .","0"
economic," 5250 . The m term in the equation for the line is the slope .","0"
economic," Remember that slope is defined as rise over run ; more specifically , the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis .","0"
economic," In this example , each time the x term increases by one ( the run ) , the y term rises by three .","0"
economic," 5256 . One common line graph is called a time series , in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable .","1"
economic," Thus , a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time .","0"
economic," 5259 . Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people ’s preferences .","0"
economic," In Consumer Choices , the level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical terms .","0"
economic," This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .","0"
economic," 5262 . Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84 — so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B .","0"
economic," Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same .","1"
economic," Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right .","0"
economic," 5265 . A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right .","0"
economic," In graphical terms , the new budget constraint will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve , representing a higher level of utility .","0"
economic," A reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left , which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve , representing a reduced level of utility .","0"
economic," 5268 . The price of haircuts rises to $ 30 .","0"
economic," Ogden starts at choice A on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve .","0"
economic," After the price of pizza increases , he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve .","0"
economic," 5271 . The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm .","0"
economic," The concept of a present discounted value ( PDV ) , which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments , can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds .","1"
economic," To place a present discounted value on a future payment , think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future .","0"
economic," 5274 . The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion .","0"
economic," The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP .","0"
economic," Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD / AS diagrams : it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital . The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line , which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right .","1"
economic," 5280 . [ link ] shows an investment function where the level of investment is , for the sake of concreteness , set at the specific level of 500 .","0"
economic," Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP ( or national income ) , the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP .","0"
economic," 5283 . Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example , and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column .","0"
economic," The final column , aggregate expenditures , sums up C + I + G + X – M .","0"
economic," This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in [ link ] .","0"
economic," 5286 . In this situation , the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level , and unemployment will occur .","0"
economic," The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap .","0"
economic," Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low , firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers , and unemployment will be high .","0"
economic," 5289 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .","0"
economic," One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .","1"
economic," 5292 . Remember , the demand curve traces consumers ’ willingness to pay for different quantities .","0"
economic," The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay , minus the amount that they actually paid , is called consumer surplus .","1"
economic," Consumer surplus is the area labeled F — that is , the area above the market price and below the demand curve .","0"
economic," Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus , which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay .","0"
economic," 5295 . First , an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced .","0"
economic," The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss .","1"
economic," In a very real sense , it is like money thrown away that benefits no one .","0"
economic," 5298 . The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply , but by the interaction between the two .","0"
economic," In 1890 , the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a price was like arguing “ whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper . ”","0"
economic," The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved .","0"
economic," 4319 . In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .","1"
economic," Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .","0"
economic," For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average .","0"
economic," 4322 . For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .","0"
economic," Fiscal policy , which involves government spending and taxes , is determined by a nation ’s legislative body .","1"
economic," For the United States , this is the Congress and the executive branch , which originates the federal budget .","0"
economic," 4325 . Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory .","0"
economic," Strictly speaking , a theory is a more abstract representation , while a model is more applied or empirical representation .","0"
economic," 4328 . There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy .","0"
economic," The first is the traditional economy , which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia , Africa , and South America .","0"
economic," Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done ( i.e. , tradition ) .","1"
economic," 4331 . The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .","0"
economic," In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .","0"
economic," Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .","1"
economic," 4334 . The Rise of GlobalizationRecent decades have seen a trend toward globalization , which is the expanding cultural , political , and economic connections between people around the world .","1"
economic," One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods , services , and assets across national borders — in other words , international trade and financial capital flows .","0"
economic," 4337 . Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .","1"
economic," The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .","1"
economic," Thus , the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country ’s total economic production is sold in other countries .","0"
economic," 4340 . In many cases , it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price .","0"
economic," If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $ 300 , then $ 300 measures the amount of “ other consumption ” that he has given up .","0"
economic," 4343 . The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern .","1"
economic," Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility , which means that as a person receives more of a good , the additional ( or marginal ) utility from each additional unit of the good declines .","0"
economic," In other words , the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth .","0"
economic," The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all - or - nothing choices .","0"
economic," 4346 . The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up .","0"
economic," Just as with Alphonso ’s budget constraint , the opportunity cost is shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier .","0"

economic," If so , read the following Clear It Up feature .","0"
economic," 4349 . In everyday usage , efficiency refers to lack of waste .","0"
economic," An inefficient machine operates at high cost , while an efficient machine operates at lower cost , because it is not wasting energy or materials .","1"
economic," An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs , while an efficient organization meets schedules , is focused , and performs within budget .","1"
economic," 4352 . For government , this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm .","0"
economic," At the individual and firm level , the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity , quality , and price that people want .","0"
economic," But for both the government and the market economy in the short term , increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy .","0"
economic," 4355 . Fortunately however , the assumption that individuals are purely self - interested is a simplification about human nature .","0"
economic," In fact , we need to look no further than to Adam Smith , the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this .","0"
economic," The opening sentence of his book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , puts it very clearly : “ How selfish soever man may be supposed , there are evidently some principles in his nature , which interest him in the fortune of others , and render their happiness necessary to him , though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it . ”","0"
economic," Clearly , individuals are both self - interested and altruistic .","0"
economic," 4358 . The third theme is economic efficiency , or getting the most benefit from scarce resources .","1"
economic," All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases , there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other .","0"
economic," 4361 . To find answers to these questions , we need to understand the concept of elasticity .","0"
economic," Elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable .","1"
economic," Suppose you drop two items from a second - floor balcony .","0"
economic," 4364 . The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .","1"
economic," The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .","1"
economic," An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .","1"
economic," 4367 . Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .","0"
economic," Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .","1"
economic," 4370 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .","1"
economic," In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," 4373 . Constant unitary elasticity , in either a supply or demand curve , occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent .","1"
economic," [ link ] shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity .","0"
economic," 4376 . Income Elasticity of Demand","0"
economic," The income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income .","1"
economic," Income elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded % change in incomeIncome elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded % change in income","0"
economic," For most products , most of the time , the income elasticity of demand is positive : that is , a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded .","1"
economic," This pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods .","0"
economic," However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .","0"
economic," 4379 . Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital MarketsThe concept of elasticity applies to any market , not just markets for goods and services .","0"
economic," In the labor market , for example , the wage elasticity of labor supply — that is , the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages — will determine the shape of the labor supply curve .","0"
economic," Specifically :","0"
economic," 4382 . If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .","0"
economic," This activity of production goes beyond manufacturing ( i.e. , making things ) .","0"
economic," It includes any process or service that creates value , including transportation , distribution , wholesale and retail sales .","0"
economic," 4385 . Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .","0"
economic," Implicit costs are more subtle , but just as important .","0"
economic," They represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm .","1"
economic," 4388 . The cost of producing a firm ’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses .","0"
economic," A list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast - food meals .","0"
economic," 4391 . Variable costs , on the other hand , are incurred in the act of producing — the more you produce , the greater the variable cost .","1"
economic," Labor is treated as a variable cost , since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours .","0"
economic," 4394 . But as output expands still further , the average cost begins to rise .","0"
economic," At the right side of the average cost curve , total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in .","0"
economic," Average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output .","0"
economic," For example , the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is $ 400 , so the average variable cost is $ 400 / 80 , or $ 5 per haircut .","0"
economic," 4397 . Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market .","0"
economic," If we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit , also known as the firm ’s profit margin .","1"
economic," Expanding the equation for profit gives :","0"
economic," 4400 . While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve ( corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen ) , in the long run when all costs are variable , they can choose to operate on any average cost curve .","0"
economic," Thus , the long - run average cost ( LRAC ) curve is actually based on a group of short - run average cost ( SRAC ) curves , each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs .","0"

economic," The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .","1"
economic," A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service .","0"
economic," 4409 . The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period ( for example , per day or per year ) and over some geographic area ( like a state or a country ) .","0"
economic," A demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like [ link ] , with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis .","1"
economic," ( Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable ( x ) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable ( y ) goes on the vertical .","0"
economic," 4412 . Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .","1"
economic," A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .","0"
economic," When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .","0"
economic," 4415 . Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .","0"
economic," A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price , shown on the vertical axis , and quantity , shown on the horizontal axis .","1"
economic," The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information .","0"
economic," 4418 . The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .","1"
economic," At any other price , the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied , so the market is not in equilibrium at that price .","0"
economic," 4421 . The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied .","0"
economic," The result was the demand curve and the supply curve .","0"

economic," Price controls come in two flavors .","0"
economic," 4439 . Markets for labor have demand and supply curves , just like markets for goods .","0"
economic," The law of demand applies in labor markets this way : A higher salary or wage — that is , a higher price in the labor market — leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers , while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded .","0"
economic," The law of supply functions in labor markets , too : A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied ; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied .","0"
economic," Equilibrium in the Labor Market","0"
economic," 4442 . The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate , under the ceteris paribus assumption .","1"

economic," Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time .","0"
economic," Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store , decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time , sometimes a long period .","0"
economic," 4451 . A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets .","0"
economic," The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive .","0"
economic," Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices .","1"

economic," This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility , which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added .","1"
economic," 4460 . The general rule can also be expressed as the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities .","0"
economic," When the price of good 1 is divided by the price of good 2 , at the utility - maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility of good 2 .","1"
economic," This rule , known as the consumer equilibrium , can be written in algebraic form :","0"
economic," 4463 . Conversely , when income falls , the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods .","0"
economic," As defined in the chapter on Demand and Supply and again in the chapter on Elasticity , goods and services are called normal goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity consumed .","1"
economic," However , depending on Kimberly ’s preferences , a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines .","0"
economic," A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .","0"
economic," 4466 . The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .","1"
economic," The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .","1"
economic," In this example , the higher price for baseball bats would cause Sergei to buy a fewer bats for both reasons .","0"
economic," 4469 . The middle , close - to - vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying about the same quantity of labor .","0"
economic," The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward - bending supply curve for labor , which is the situation of high - wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still - higher wage by working fewer hours .","1"

Firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur : ( 1 ) many firms produce identical products ; ( 2 ) many buyers are available to buy the product , and many sellers are available to sell the product ; ( 3 ) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold ; and ( 4 ) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions — in other words , there is free entry and exit into and out of the market .","1"

economic," When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry .","1"
economic," Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee .","0"
economic," If a business is making losses in the short run , it will either keep limping along or just shut down , depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs .","0"
economic," 4487 . Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that , in the long run , pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit . To understand how short - run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run , imagine the following situation .","0"
economic," The market is in long - run equilibrium , where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC .","0"
economic," No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market .","0"
economic," 4490 . For a decreasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience lower costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a lower price than before .","1"
economic," In this case , the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs .","0"
economic," 4493 . In this chapter , we explore the opposite extreme : monopoly . If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price , monopoly is a market with no competition at all , and firms have complete market power .","0"
economic," In the case of monopoly , one firm produces all of the output in a market .","1"
economic," Since a monopoly faces no significant competition , it can charge any price it wishes .","0"
economic," 4496 . One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .","1"
economic," The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .","1"
economic," 4499 . A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good , like Chiquita bananas , Chevrolet cars , or the Nike “ swoosh ” that appears on shoes and athletic gear .","1"
economic," Roughly 1.9 million trademarks are registered with the U.S. government .","0"
economic," 4502 . Taken together , this combination of patents , trademarks , copyrights , and trade secret law is called intellectual property , because it implies ownership over an idea , concept , or image , not a physical piece of property like a house or a car .","1"
economic," Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property , although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries .","0"
economic," 4505 . Profits for the monopolist , like any firm , will be equal to total revenues minus total costs .","0"
economic," The pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm — that is , by using total cost , fixed cost , variable cost , marginal cost , average cost , and average variable cost .","0"
economic," However , because a monopoly faces no competition , its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm .","0"
economic," 4508 . [ link ] repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from [ link ] , and adds two more columns : Marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold .","1"

economic," What determines their behavior ?","0"
economic," 4514 . Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other , but selling products that are distinctive in some way .","1"
economic," Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing ; restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food ; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names .","0"
economic," 4517 . A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition .","1"
economic," [ link ] offers a reminder that the demand curve as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat , because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market price .","0"
economic," In contrast , the demand curve , as faced by a monopolist , is the market demand curve , since a monopolist is the only firm in the market , and hence is downward sloping .","0"
economic," 4520 . As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .","0"
economic," The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .","0"
economic," 4523 . The long - term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve .","0"
economic," This outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency : goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost .","0"
economic," However , in monopolistic competition , the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve , not at the very bottom of the AC curve .","0"
economic," 4526 . Similarly , a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .","0"
economic," In such a setting , the market has room for only one firm , because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete , and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market .","0"
economic," 4529 . When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .","1"
economic," A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .","1"
economic," See the following Clear It Up feature for a more in - depth analysis of the difference between the two .","0"
economic," 4532 . Because of the complexity of oligopoly , which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms , there is no single , generally - accepted theory of how oligopolies behave , in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures .","1"
economic," Instead , economists use game theory , a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do .","1"
economic," Game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences , as well as in business , law , and military strategy .","0"
economic," 4535 . The result of this prisoner ’s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist , the two firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only $ 400 each in profits .","0"
economic," The following Clear It Up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular .","0"
economic," 4538 . If one firm cuts its price to $ 300 , it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats .","0"
economic," However , if the airline seeks to raise prices , the other oligopolists will not raise their prices , and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of sales .","0"
economic," 4541 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .","1"
economic," When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .","1"
economic," An acquisition may not look just like a merger , since the newly purchased firm may continue to be operated under its former company name .","0"
economic," 4544 . In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .","0"
economic," In 1914 , the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions ( where the outcome would be to “ substantially lessen competition ” in an industry ) , price discrimination ( where different customers are charged different prices for the same product ) , and tied sales ( where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product ) .","1"
economic," Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .","0"
economic," 4547 . An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .","1"
economic," For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .","0"
economic," The four - firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms : in this case , 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40 .","0"
economic," 4550 . However , in the total market for all computer software and services , including everything from games to scientific programs , the Microsoft share was only about 14 % in 2014 .","0"
economic," A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . There are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades : one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization .","1"
economic," In addition , these two shifts are interconnected .","0"
economic," 4553 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .","1"
economic," Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others .","0"
economic," For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .","1"
economic," A minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers .","0"
economic," 4556 . Even if a customer was interested in a portable TV , the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market .","0"
economic," A related , but not identical , concept is called bundling , where two or more products are sold as one .","1"
economic," Bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price .","0"
economic," 4559 . A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy , because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly .","0"
economic," A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand .","1"
economic," This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs .","0"
economic," 4562 . They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies , added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn , and set the price for consumers accordingly .","1"
economic," This method was known as cost - plus regulation .","0"
economic," 4565 . One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture , in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow .","1"
economic," When the airline industry was being regulated , for example , it suggested appointees to the regulatory board , sent lobbyists to argue with the board , provided most of the information on which the board made decisions , and offered well - paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board .","0"
economic," 4568 . Private markets , such as the cell phone industry , offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced , how they are produced , and who gets them .","0"
economic," The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking .","0"
economic," 4571 . Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers .","1"
economic," Externalities can be negative or positive .","0"
economic," If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .","0"
economic," If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .","0"
economic," 4574 . In a market with no anti - pollution restrictions , firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free .","0"
economic," Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .","0"
economic," If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .","0"
economic," 4577 . Other laws required the installation of certain equipment — for example , on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks — to reduce pollution .","0"
economic," These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation .","0"
economic," In effect , command - and - control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account .","1"
economic," Command - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment .","0"
economic," 4580 . A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits .","1"
economic," A pollution charge gives a profit - maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions — as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax .","0"
economic," 4583 . Another application of marketable permits occurred when the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990 .","0"
economic," The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain , which harms forests as well as buildings .","0"
economic," 4586 . The definition of ecotourism is a little vague .","1"
economic," Does it mean sleeping on the ground , eating roots , and getting close to wild animals ?","0"
economic," 4589 . No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming — not without the cooperation of other nations .","0"
economic," Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity , which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material .","1"
economic," Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world .","0"
economic," 4592 . The tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) such as the one shown in [ link ] .","1"
economic," At one extreme , at a choice like P , a country would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection .","0"
economic," 4595 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .","1"
economic," However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .","1"
economic," Revisit Choice in a World of Scarcity for more on these terms .","0"

economic," If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .","0"
economic," 4601 . The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .","1"
economic," As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .","1"
economic," Economists and scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return .","0"
economic," 4604 . After all , if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education , society should expect some kind of return on that spending .","0"
economic," Again , economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that , across a variety of nations , the social rate of return on schooling is also positive .","0"
economic," After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .","0"
economic," 4607 . Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .","1"
economic," For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .","0"
economic," Without a patent , the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products , and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit .","0"
economic," 4610 . Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .","0"
economic," The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity .","1"

economic," 4616 . While we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA ’s space projects , we should also acknowledge that those benefits are not shared equally .","0"
economic," Economists like Tyler Cowen , a professor at George Mason University , are seeing more and more evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology , and those who do not .","0"
economic," According to Cowen author of the recent book , Average Is Over : Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation , this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills , and ultimately , in wages and global standards of living .","0"
economic," 4619 . Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .","1"
economic," Income inequality compares the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , comparing the share of income received by the top 10 % to the share of income received by the bottom 10 % .","1"
economic," 4622 . After all , according to the Federal Register , the median household income for a family of four was $ 102,552 in New Jersey and $ 57,132 in Mississippi in 2013 , and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states .","0"
economic," The poverty line is based on cash income , which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non - cash form , like Medicaid ( health care for low - income individuals and families ) and food aid .","1"
economic," Also , low - income families can qualify for federal housing assistance .","0"
economic," 4625 . At the other extreme of the budget constraint line , an individual would work zero hours , earn zero income , but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure .","0"
economic," At point A on the budget constraint line , by working 40 hours a week , 50 weeks a year , the utility - maximizing choice is to work a total of 2,000 hours per year and earn $ 16,000 .","0"

economic," In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .","0"
economic," 4631 . [ link ] illustrates that the earned income tax credits , child tax credits , and the TANF program all cost the federal government money — either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues .","0"
economic," CTC stands for the government tax cuts for the child tax credit .","0"
economic," Real Federal Spending on CTC , EITC , and TANF , 1975 - 2013EITC increased from more than $ 20 billion in 2000 to over an estimated $ 50 billion by 2013 , far exceeding estimated 2013 outlays in the CTC ( Child Tax Credits ) and TANF of over $ 20 billion and $ 10 billion , respectively .","0"

economic," The effective income tax , which is total taxes paid divided by total income ( all sources of income such as wages , profits , interest , rental income , and government transfers such as veterans ’ benefits ) , was much lower .","1"
economic," The effective tax paid by the top 1 % of householders was 20.4 % , while the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes , because of provisions like the earned income tax credit .","0"
economic," 4649 . This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product , but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms .","0"
economic," At the higher union wage Wu , the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium .","0"
economic," 4652 . Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries , the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were .","0"
economic," It is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers , including the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) ; the Service Employees International Union ; and the National Education Association .","1"
economic," The membership of each of these unions is listed in [ link ] .","0"

economic," For example , the Equal Pay Act of 1963 said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same .","1"
economic," The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .","1"
economic," 4664 . One disruptive effect , as just noted , is that immigration weighted toward low - skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low - skill workers .","0"
economic," A study by Michael S. Clune found that for each 10 % rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market , high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3 % .","0"
economic," The effects on wages of low - skill workers are not large — perhaps in the range of decline of about 1 % .","0"
economic," 4667 . Many economic transactions are made in a situation of imperfect information , where either the buyer , the seller , or both , are less than 100 % certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold .","1"
economic," Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .","1"
economic," 4670 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .","1"
economic," By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .","1"
economic," 4676 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .","1"
economic," The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .","1"
economic," 4682 . Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .","1"
economic," Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .","1"
economic," 4685 . Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs .","0"
economic," Some of the programs look much like private insurance , in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund , and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments .","0"
economic," Other programs protect against risk , but without an explicit fund being set up .","0"
economic," 4688 . Deposit insurance : Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to $ 250,000 ( the amount was raised from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in 2008 ) if the bank should go bankrupt .","1"
economic," 4691 . Some drivers are safer than others .","0"
economic," A risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring .","1"
economic," 4694 . For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .","0"
economic," Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .","1"
economic," Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .","1"
economic," 4697 . However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .","0"
economic," A health maintenance organization ( HMO ) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan — regardless of how many services are provided .","1"
economic," In this case , a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care , but the healthcare provider , which is receiving only a fixed payment , has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided — as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later .","0"
economic," 4703 . The profit trend has since continued to increase each year , though at a less steady or consistent rate .","0"

economic," 4721 . A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners .","0"
economic," Most private companies are relatively small , but there are some large private corporations , with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales , that do not have publicly issued stock , such as farm products dealer Cargill , the Mars candy company , and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm .","0"
economic," When a firm decides to sell stock , which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors , it is called a public company .","1"
economic," Shareholders own a public company .","0"
economic," 4724 . The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor , either in future interest payments , capital gains , or increased profitability .","1"
economic," It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .","0"
economic," 4730 . Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit ( CD ) .","0"
economic," With a CD , as it is commonly called , you agree to deposit a certain amount of money , often measured in thousands of dollars , in the account for a stated period of time , typically ranging from a few months to several years .","1"
economic," 4733 . A bond is basically an “ I owe you ” note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital ( money ) .","0"
economic," The bond has a face value .","0"
economic," This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .","1"
economic," 4736 . The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .","1"
economic," Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .","1"
economic," This may or may not be the same as the face value .","0"

economic," Broad measures of the stock market , like the ones listed here , tend to move together .","0"
economic," 4742 . At the other end of the spectrum , a mutual fund might be quite broad ; at the extreme , some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market , and thus the value of the mutual fund will fluctuate with the average of the overall stock market .","0"
economic," A mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the overall performance of the market is called an index fund .","1"
economic," 4745 . Simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount .","1"
economic," 4748 . A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference .","1"
economic," This theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high , or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election .","1"
economic," In a 1957 work , An Economic Theory of Democracy , the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this way : “ It seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy , rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se .","0"
economic," No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information , or how uncertain he is about which party to support , he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome … He will not even utilize all the free information available , since assimilating it takes time . ”","0"
economic," In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two , the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters , who states : “ The chance that one man ’s vote will decide the issue in a national election … is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls . ”","0"

economic," ) Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation , but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue .","1"
economic," A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not benefit society as a whole .","0"
economic," 4754 . In the early 2000s , about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for Medicare , a government program that provides health insurance for those 65 and older .","1"
economic," On some issues , the elderly are a powerful interest group .","0"
economic," 4757 . In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies .","0"
economic," However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying .","0"
economic," HCAN , spending $ 60 million dollars , was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014 .","0"
economic," 4760 . A nonprofit watchdog organization , called Citizens against Government Waste , produces an annual report , the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork - barrel spending , focusing on items that were requested by only one member of Congress , that were passed into law without any public hearings , or that serve only a local purpose .","1"
economic," Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial , of course , but at least by this measure , pork - barrel spending totaled $ 2.7 billion in 2014.Pork - barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling , an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor .","1"
economic," For example , if one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district , the other members might oppose it .","0"
economic," 4763 . This case goes against the theory of the “ median ” voter in a democracy .","0"
economic," The median voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences .","1"
economic," If we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right , the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum .","0"
economic," 4766 . These three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions .","0"
economic," As the famous British economist Joan Robinson wrote some decades ago : “ [ E ] conomic theory , in itself , preaches no doctrines and can not establish any universally valid laws .","0"

economic," 4769 . How large is the U.S. economy ?","0"
economic," The size of a nation ’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year .","1"
economic," The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services — smart phones , cars , music downloads , computers , steel , bananas , college educations , and all other new goods and services produced in the current year — and summing them into a total dollar value .","0"
economic," 4772 . If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .","0"
economic," Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand , typically accounting for only about 15–18 % of GDP , but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created .","0"
economic," However , it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption .","0"
economic," 4775 . Since the early 1980s , imports have typically exceeded exports , and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years .","0"
economic," Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .","0"
economic," 4778 . They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year .","0"
economic," Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting , in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production .","1"
economic," For example , imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer , and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires .","0"
economic," 4781 . One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product ( GNP ) .","0"
economic," GDP includes only what is produced within a country ’s borders .","0"
economic," 4787 . GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy .","1"
economic," We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation , but this definition will do in the context of this chapter .","0"
economic," 4790 . The generally upward long - term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short - term declines .","0"
economic," A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .","1"
economic," An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .","1"
economic," 4793 . [ link ] lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900 .","0"
economic," The highest point of the economy , before the recession begins , is called the peak ; conversely , the lowest point of a recession , before a recovery begins , is called the trough .","1"
economic," Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .","0"
economic," 4796 . To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies , it is necessary to convert to a “ common denominator ” using an exchange rate , which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency .","1"
economic," Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .","0"
economic," 4802 . Let ’s begin with a brief overview of the spectacular patterns of economic growth around the world in the last two centuries , commonly referred to as the period of modern economic growth .","1"
economic," ( Later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key ingredients for economic progress . )","0"
economic," 4805 . Economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition .","0"
economic," Richard Easterlin , an economist at the University of Southern California , wrote in 2000 :","0"
economic," 4811 . A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .","1"
economic," In macroeconomics , the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function .","1"
economic," 4814 . The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads ( also called infrastructure ) .","1"
economic," Again , greater physical capital implies more output .","0"
economic," 4817 . To obtain a per capita production function , divide each input in [ link ] ( a ) by the population .","0"
economic," This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita ( that is , GDP divided by population ) .","1"
economic," The inputs are the average level of human capital per person , the average level of physical capital per person , and the level of technology per person — see [ link ] ( b ) .","0"
economic," 4820 . The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research .","0"
economic," The researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales .","0"
economic," Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies .","0"
economic," 4823 . High - income countries must continually invent new technologies , whereas low - income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood .","0"
economic," The economist Alexander Gerschenkron ( 1904 – 1978 ) gave this phenomenon a memorable name : “ the advantages of backwardness . ”","0"
economic," Of course , he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living .","0"
economic," He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up .","0"
economic," 4826 . It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking , often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment .","0"
economic," Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force .","0"
economic," 4829 . Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate .","0"
economic," This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job .","1"
economic," 4832 . One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census .","0"
economic," But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly .","0"
economic," Instead , workers in these countries are engaged in short - term work , subsistence activities , and barter .","0"
economic," 4835 . From the standpoint of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets , unemployment represents something of a puzzle .","0"
economic," In a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity .","1"
economic," At the equilibrium wage ( We ) , the equilibrium quantity ( Qe ) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers .","0"
economic," 4838 . Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy , not just a few .","0"
economic," A number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone .","0"
economic," 4841 . The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment alternatives at other firms , are the most likely to leave .","1"
economic," The least attractive workers , with fewer employment alternatives , are more likely to stay .","0"
economic," 4844 . Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ?","0"
economic," Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment .","1"
economic," 4847 . Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment .","0"
economic," The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market , either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills .","1"
economic," 4850 . Moreover , the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services , but wages and income levels , too .","0"
economic," The second - to - last row of [ link ] shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six - fold from 1970 to 2014 .","0"
economic," 4853 . Step 1 .","0"
economic," Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods .","0"
economic," The general equation for percentage changes between two years , whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation , is :","0"
economic," 4856 . The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .","0"
economic," The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .","1"
economic," 4859 . If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years , until its price is already lower , the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether .","0"
economic," Taking these arguments together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living .","1"
economic," The following Clear It Up feature is a must - read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated .","0"
economic," 4862 . It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .","0"
economic," There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .","0"
economic," An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .","1"
economic," 4865 . The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms : they are right after World War I and World War II .","0"
economic," However , there are also two periods of severe negative inflation — called deflation — in the early decades of the twentieth century : one following the deep recession of 1920–21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s .","1"
economic," ( Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced , deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases . )","0"
economic," 4868 . Economists usually oppose high inflation , but they oppose it in a milder way than many non - economists .","0"
economic," Robert Shiller , one of 2013 ’s Nobel Prize winners in economics , carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation .","0"
economic," One of his questions asked , “ Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools ? ”","0"
economic," Answers were on a scale of 1–5 , where 1 meant “ Fully agree ” and 5 meant “ Completely disagree . ” For the U.S. population as a whole , 52 % answered “ Fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4 % said “ Completely disagree . ” However , among professional economists , only 18 % answered “ Fully agree , ” while the same percentage of 18 % answered “ Completely disagree . ”","0"
economic," The Land of Funny Money","0"
economic," 4871 . If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .","0"
economic," However , if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation , or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag , then inflation can cause three types of problems : unintended redistributions of purchasing power , blurred price signals , and difficulties in long - term planning .","0"
economic," 4874 . One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : retirees who receive a private company pension .","0"
economic," Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement .","1"
economic," For this reason , pensions are called “ defined benefits ” plans .","0"
economic," 4877 . High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker .","1"
economic," Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages .","0"
economic," 4880 . When a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation , it is said to be indexed .","1"
economic," An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .","1"
economic," 4883 . Loans often have built - in inflation adjustments , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well .","0"
economic," An adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation .","1"
economic," Often , a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM , compared to a fixed - rate loan .","0"
economic," 4886 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .","1"
economic," Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .","0"
economic," 4889 . At some point , foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries .","0"
economic," The economy then drops into deep recession , with real GDP often falling up to 10 % or more in a single year .","0"
economic," This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1 % .","0"
economic," 4892 . Do not confuse the balance of trade ( which tracks imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and transfers .","0"
economic," 4895 . Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .","0"
economic," For example , U.S. exports of services were equal to about one - half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014 , compared to one - fifth in 1980.The third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money flowing into the United States ) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here ( money flowing out of the United States ) .","1"
economic," The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil : it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market .","0"
economic," 4898 . As economists see it , trade surpluses can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too .","0"
economic," The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital .","0"
economic," In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways : a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments .","0"
economic," 4901 . Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country .","0"
economic," Similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world .","0"
economic," The investment income ( bottom lines two and four ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines one and three ) are found in the financial account .","0"
economic," 4904 . The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true .","0"
economic," Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital .","0"
economic," 4907 . When Japan ’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade surpluses were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health .","0"
economic," But from a standpoint of economic growth , Japan ’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990 , with real GDP growth averaging only about 1 % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher .","0"
economic," Clearly , a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health .","0"
economic," 4910 . How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ?","0"
economic," Is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000 , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009 ?","0"
economic," Why did the current account deficit rise so high , but then decline in 2009 ?","0"
economic," 4913 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767 – 1832 ) .","0"
economic," Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .","1"
economic," The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall .","0"
economic," 4916 . Nevertheless , a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes .","0"
economic," A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size , business failures outnumber the remaining success stories , and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers .","1"
economic," Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run .","0"
economic," Over periods of some years or decades , as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases , total demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace .","0"
economic," 4919 . Profits , in turn , are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs , like labor or raw materials , the firm needs to buy .","0"
economic," Aggregate supply ( AS ) refers to the total quantity of output ( i.e .","1"
economic," real GDP ) firms will produce and sell .","1"
economic," 4922 . When an economy is operating at its potential GDP , machines and factories are running at capacity , and the unemployment rate is relatively low — at the natural rate of unemployment .","0"
economic," For this reason , potential GDP is sometimes also called full - employment GDP .","0"
economic," 4925 . The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries , then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world .","0"
economic," U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .","0"
economic," U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .","0"
economic," 4928 . For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .","0"
economic," The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .","0"
economic," 4931 . For example , the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974 – 1975 , 1980 – 1982 , 1990 – 91 , 2001 , and 2007 – 2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices .","0"
economic," In the 1970s , this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation .","0"
economic," Conversely , a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right , providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs .","0"
economic," From 1985 to 1986 , for example , the average price of crude oil fell by almost half , from $ 24 a barrel to $ 12 a barrel .","0"
economic," 4934 . If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you , remember that since GDP was about $ 14.4 trillion in 2009 , a seemingly small change of 2 % of GDP is equal to close to $ 300 billion . Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending , too .","0"
economic," Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand , while tax increases will tend to diminish it .","0"
economic," Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment .","0"
economic," 4937 . Two types of unemployment were described in the Unemployment chapter .","0"
economic," Cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short - run movements of GDP .","1"
economic," Over the long run , in the United States , the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5 % ( give or take one percentage point or so ) , when the economy is healthy .","0"
economic," 4940 . Focus first on the Keynesian zone , that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat .","1"
economic," If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek , then certain statements about the economic situation will follow .","0"
economic," 4943 . The idea is simple : firms produce output only if they expect it to sell .","0"
economic," Thus , while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation ’s potential GDP , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real GDP , depends on how much demand exists across the economy .","1"
economic," This point is illustrated in [ link ] .","0"
economic," The Keynesian AD / AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD / AS Model uses an SRAS curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output .","0"
economic," 4946 . As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .","0"
economic," The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output . Recall from The Aggregate Supply - Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services .","1"
economic," ( Aggregate demand ( AD ) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure .","0"
economic," 4949 . Spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure .","1"
economic," Investment falls into four categories : producer ’s durable equipment and software , new nonresidential structures ( such as factories , offices , and retail locations ) , changes in inventories , and residential structures ( such as single - family homes , townhouses , and apartment buildings ) .","0"
economic," 4952 . ) Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects .","1"
economic," The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks .","0"
economic," First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .","0"
economic," 4955 . Second , frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry — especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected .","1"
economic," These costs of changing prices are called menu costs — like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant .","0"
economic," Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand , but from a macroeconomic perspective , the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time .","0"
economic," 4958 . Thus , when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression , it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP .","0"
economic," The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus package , officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .","0"
economic," 4961 . Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation .","0"
economic," This pattern became known as stagflation .","0"
economic," ( Recall from The Aggregate Demand / Aggregate Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation . )","1"
economic," 4964 . He proposed that the government could bury money underground , and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again .","0"
economic," These suggestions were slightly tongue - in - cheek , but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP .","0"
economic," 4967 . The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that , in the long run , the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment .","0"
economic," This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output .","0"
economic," 4970 . Actual or real GDP is benchmarked against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing .","0"
economic," Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .","0"
economic," 4973 . Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential GDP ) will determine the real GDP of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand .","0"
economic," Over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right .","0"
economic," 4976 . After all , many people and firms are not especially well informed , either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works .","0"
economic," An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory .","1"
economic," If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time . The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear - cut .","0"
economic," 4979 . The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve .","0"
economic," The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve ; thus , there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run .","0"
economic," 4982 . Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment .","0"
economic," Instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low .","0"
economic," 4985 . However , the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years .","0"
economic," Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long - lasting recession , like the Great Depression of the 1930s .","0"
economic," Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment .","0"
economic," 4988 . At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !","0"
economic," : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .","0"
economic," We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals .","0"
economic," You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .","0"
economic," With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing .","1"
economic," 4991 . ( We will get to its definition soon . )","0"
economic," First , money serves as a medium of exchange , which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller .","0"
economic," Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes , the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money .","0"
economic," 4994 . Finally , another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of deferred payment .","0"
economic," This means that if money is usable today to make purchases , it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future .","1"
economic," 4997 . Of course , gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry .","0"
economic," As commodity money , gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange , a store of value , and as a unit of account .","0"
economic," Commodity - backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank .","1"
economic," During much of its history , the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver .","0"
economic," 5000 .","0"
economic," less liquid .","0"
economic," The Federal Reserve Bank , which is the central bank of the United States , is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity .","1"
economic," There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .","0"
economic," 5003 . A broader definition of money , M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits .","0"
economic," For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .","1"
economic," Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .","0"
economic," 5006 . Where does “ plastic money ” like debit cards , credit cards , and smart money fit into this picture ?","0"
economic," A debit card , like a check , is an instruction to the user ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller .","1"
economic," It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .","0"
economic," 5009 . One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts .","0"
economic," Indeed , the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system .","0"
economic," The next section explains how banks function and how a nation ’s banking system has the power to create money .","0"
economic," 5012 . Banks as Financial IntermediariesAn “ intermediary ” is one who stands between two other parties .","1"
economic," Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .","1"
economic," Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .","0"
economic," 5015 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .","1"
economic," An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .","1"
economic," 5018 . In this case , a home is the asset , but the mortgage is the liability .","0"
economic," The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed ( the liability ) . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .","1"
economic," 5021 . Many banks issue home loans , and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments .","0"
economic," The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market .","1"
economic," One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived riskiness of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly , what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid ?","1"
economic," The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid , the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan .","0"
economic," 5024 . Securitization offers certain advantages .","0"
economic," If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines , so that many people are unable to make their payments .","0"
economic," 5027 . Clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers .","0"
economic," How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset - liability time mismatch ?","0"
economic," One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans , which means lending to a variety of customers .","1"
economic," For example , suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market — say , making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area .","0"
economic," 5030 . The organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation ’s financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank .","1"
economic," Most nations have central banks or currency boards .","0"
economic," 5033 . A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve .","0"
economic," The goal is not only to protect individuals ’ savings , but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself .","0"
economic," 5036 . Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses , individuals , and other banks .","0"
economic," They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky .","0"
economic," Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .","1"
economic," In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .","0"
economic," 5039 . The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank ’s assets is not always straightforward .","0"
economic," As discussed in Money and Banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid .","1"
economic," These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan .","0"
economic," The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off .","0"
economic," 5042 . About 70 countries around the world , including all of the major economies , have deposit insurance programs .","0"
economic," In the United States , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is responsible for deposit insurance .","1"
economic," Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC .","0"
economic," 5045 . The most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations .","0"
economic," Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates .","1"
economic," 5048 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .","1"
economic," If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .","0"
economic," 5051 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .","1"
economic," Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .","1"
economic," 5054 . Of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time .","0"
economic," In general , when the federal funds rate drops substantially , other interest rates drop , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise .","0"
economic," 5057 . In [ link ] ( b ) , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) occurs at an output of 750 , which is above potential GDP .","0"
economic," A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates , discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( AD0 ) to shift left to AD1 , so that the new equilibrium ( E1 ) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical ; that is , it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings .","1"
economic," Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens .","0"
economic," 5060 . With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .","0"
economic," This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .","1"
economic," 5063 . Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit .","0"
economic," For example , during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend , because they fear that when the economy is contracting , a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans .","0"
economic," 5066 . Unpredictable Movements of VelocityVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy .","1"
economic," The velocity of money in a year is defined as :","0"
economic," 5069 . Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation .","1"
economic," If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and the rate of inflation is 3 % , then the borrower is effectively paying a 4 % real interest rate .","0"
economic," If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and there is deflation of 2 % , then the real interest rate is actually 9 % .","0"
economic," 5072 . So far at least , it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down fluctuations in M1 .","0"
economic," Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking , M2 is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1 .","0"
economic," 5075 . In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .","0"
economic," If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0 , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter GDP or unemployment .","0"
economic," From this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy .","0"
economic," 5078 . Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account .","0"
economic," Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .","0"
economic," For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP .","0"
economic," In some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment .","0"
economic," 5081 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ”","1"
economic," When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .","0"
economic," Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .","1"
economic," 5084 . This chapter discusses the international dimension of money , which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate .","0"
economic," An exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of one currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand .","1"
economic," The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates .","0"
economic," 5087 . You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters .","0"
economic," In The International Trade and Capital Flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare GDP statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies .","0"
economic," These earlier examples , however , took the actual exchange rate as given , as if it were a fact of nature .","0"
economic," 5090 . The other kind of international financial investment , portfolio investment , involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility .","1"
economic," An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom , or deposited money in a British bank .","0"
economic," 5093 . These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .","0"
economic," This is called the interbank market .","0"
economic," 5096 . The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market .","0"
economic," The demand curve ( D ) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve ( S ) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point ( E ) , which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos .","0"
economic," Note that the two exchange rates are inverses : 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso ( or $ 0.10 per peso ) .","0"
economic," 5099 . If the price of cars was much higher than $ 32,000 in this example , then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars .","0"
economic," This is known as arbitrage , the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit .","1"
economic," It may occur slowly , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries .","0"
economic," 5102 . A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country .","0"
economic," Let ’s discuss these scenarios in turn .","0"
economic," Exchange Rates , Aggregate Demand , and Aggregate Supply","0"
economic," 5105 . In 1997 – 1998 , countries across eastern Asia , like Thailand , Korea , Malaysia , and Indonesia , experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies , in some cases 50 % or more .","0"
economic," These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital , with bank lending increasing by 20 % to 30 % per year through the mid- 1990s .","0"
economic," When their exchange rates depreciated , the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt .","0"
economic," 5108 . A policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a floating exchange rate .","1"
economic," The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate , as are the currencies of about 40 % of the countries in the world economy .","0"
economic," 5111 . When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ peg ” for its currency .","1"
economic," A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .","1"
economic," With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .","1"
economic," 5114 . The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals , use the reals to purchase foreign currencies , and avoid selling any of its own currency .","0"
economic," In this way , it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency .","0"
economic," 5117 . For example , when a country pegs its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg .","0"
economic," With a soft peg exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate .","0"
economic," With a hard peg policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg .","0"
economic," 5120 . Thus , even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short - term fluctuations of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when anticipated in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act .","0"
economic," The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows — capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment .","0"
economic," 5123 . But proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties .","0"
economic," Taxes are imposed by national governments , not international ones .","0"
economic," 5126 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !","0"
economic," Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .","0"
economic," While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .","0"
economic," 5129 . When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .","1"
economic," Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .","1"
economic," If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .","1"
economic," 5132 . When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .","0"
economic," The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue .","0"
economic," The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .","0"
economic," Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time .","0"
economic," 5135 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .","1"
economic," The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .","1"
economic," 5138 . The federal government has a few other , smaller sources of revenue .","0"
economic," It imposes an excise tax — that is , a tax on a particular good — on gasoline , tobacco , and alcohol .","1"
economic," As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .","0"
economic," 5141 . Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits .","0"
economic," The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year .","1"
economic," [ link ] shows the ratio of debt / GDP since 1940 .","0"
economic," 5144 . The millions of unemployed in 2008 – 2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries .","0"
economic," Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy , when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels .","1"
economic," The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .","0"
economic," 5147 . In the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation , were a thing of the past .","0"
economic," On the cover of its December 31 , 1965 , issue , Time magazine , then the premier news magazine in the United States , ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes , and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “ the prime influence on the world ’s economies . ”","0"
economic," The article reported that policymakers have “ used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices . ”","0"
economic," This happy consensus , however , did not last .","0"
economic," The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970 , a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975 , and then double - dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982 .","0"
economic," 5150 . It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started , and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two - month blip .","0"
economic," The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag .","1"
economic," After this lag , policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills .","0"
economic," 5153 . Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement .","0"
economic," After all , in the short term , economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers .","0"
economic," 5156 . The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets .","0"
economic," The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded .","0"
economic," The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings .","0"
economic," Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G )","1"
economic," Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G )","0"
economic," These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad .","0"
economic," 5159 . If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .","0"
economic," When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out .","1"
economic," To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .","0"
economic," In 2005 , for example , the budget deficit was roughly 4 % of GDP .","0"
economic," 5162 . Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits , causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment .","0"
economic," If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .","0"
economic," In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment .","0"
economic," On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .","0"
economic," 5165 . Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education .","0"
economic," If low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role .","0"
economic," 5168 . Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits .","0"
economic," [ link ] shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar , measured in euros .","0"
economic," At the original equilibrium ( E0 ) , where the demand for U.S. dollars ( D0 ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars ( S0 ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $ 100 billion per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid- 2000s ) .","0"
economic," 5171 . You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations .","0"
economic," As explained in The Macroeconomic Perspective , we must consider using purchasing power parity or “ international dollars ” to convert average incomes into comparable units .","0"
economic," Purchasing power parity , as formally defined in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries .","0"
economic," The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP , the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution .","0"
economic," 5174 . Where does economic growth come from ?","0"
economic," According to most economists who believe in the growth consensus , economic growth ( as discussed in Economic Growth ) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements .","0"
economic," In turn , productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology , all interacting in a market - driven economy .","0"
economic," 5177 . Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital .","0"
economic," Recent research by two MIT economists , Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo , has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty .","0"
economic," For example , the average citizen of Burundi , the lowest - income country , subsists on $ 150 per year ( adjusted to 2005 dollars ) .","0"
economic," According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook , as of 2013 , 90 % of Burundi ’s population is agrarian , with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop .","0"
economic," 5180 . The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .","0"
economic," In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates .","0"
economic," With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .","0"
economic," There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .","0"
economic," 5183 . Policymakers of the high - income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation .","0"
economic," First , whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term .","0"
economic," 5186 . There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental dangers , unfair labor practices , and many other concerns .","0"
economic," These arguments are discussed at some length in The International Trade and Capital Flows . Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade , perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument ; that is , subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established .","1"
economic," ( Globalization and Protectionism explains this concept in more detail . )","0"
economic," 5189 . Instead of offering net financial investment abroad , the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world .","0"
economic," These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to Sebastian Edwards writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research .","0"
economic," While trade deficits on their own are not bad , the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily .","0"
economic," 5192 . The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I .","0"
economic," Over that time , global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1 % of GDP in 1820 to 9 % of GDP in 1913 .","0"
economic," 5195 . A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good .","1"
economic," Absolute advantage can be the result of a country ’s natural endowment .","0"
economic," 5198 . To simplify , let ’s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours ( see [ link ] ) .","0"
economic," We illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) graph , shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources , in this case workers , and its level of technology .","0"
economic," 5201 . Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries .","0"
economic," It answers the question , “ How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico ? ”","0"
economic," Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently .","0"
economic," 5204 . Moreover , the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in certain products , and then exchange those products .","1"
economic," A high proportion of trade , however , is intra - industry trade — that is , trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another .","1"
economic," For example , the United States produces and exports autos and imports autos .","0"
economic," 5207 . In fact , recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain .","0"
economic," The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages .","0"
economic," As indicated in the beginning of the chapter , the production of the iPhone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the United States , parts supplied from Korea , the assembly of the parts in China , and the advertising and marketing done in the United States .","0"
economic," 5210 . Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .","1"
economic," Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .","0"
economic," 5213 . When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism .","1"
economic," Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition .","0"
economic," 5216 . Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules , regulations , inspections , and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products .","1"
economic," A rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas , for instance .","0"
economic," 5219 . The extra 15 tons of sugar production , shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil , is exported to the United States .","0"
economic," In the United States , at a price of 16 cents , the farmers produce a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons .","0"
economic," 5222 . It matters because the support of farmers in high - income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low - income countries .","0"
economic," Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .","0"
economic," 5225 . U.S. producers obtain a higher price so they sell a larger quantity of sugar .","0"
economic," The effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States can be measured using two concepts developed in Demand , Supply , and Efficiency : consumer surplus and producer surplus .","0"
economic," U.S .","0"
economic," Sugar Supply and Demand When there is free trade , the equilibrium is at point A .","0"
economic," 5228 . Lost sales translate into lost jobs .","0"
economic," The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries .","0"
economic," This is why the United States International Trade Commission , in its study of barriers to trade , predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs .","0"
economic," 5231 . Workers in many low - income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the United States .","0"
economic," Workers in countries like China , Thailand , Brazil , South Africa , and Poland are often paid less than the United States minimum wage .","0"
economic," For example , in the United States , the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour ; a typical wage in many low - income countries might be more like $ 7.25 per day , or often much less .","0"
economic," 5234 . Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .","1"
economic," Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .","1"
economic," Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .","0"
economic," 5237 . In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards .","0"
economic," In contrast , middle- and low - income countries like Brazil , Nigeria , India , and China have lower environmental standards .","0"
economic," 5240 . One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that almost any product can be touted by lobbyists and politicians as vital to national security .","0"
economic," In 1954 , the United States became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms , so it declared wool and mohair to be “ strategic materials ” and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers .","0"
economic," 5243 . There are different types of economic integration across the globe , ranging from free trade agreements , in which participants allow each other ’s imports without tariffs or quotas , to common markets , in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group , to full economic unions , in which , in addition to a common market , monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated .","1"
economic," Many nations belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements .","0"
economic," 5246 . Because of Technotron ’s new technology — which in this case is importing goods from another county — other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers .","0"
economic," Just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it down , it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade .","0"
economic," 5249 . To a mathematician or an economist , a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values .","1"
economic," In the equation of a line presented above , x and y are the variables , with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis , and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line .","0"
economic," 5252 . A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related ; that is , when x increases , y decreases , or when x decreases , y increases .","1"
economic," Graphically , a negative slope means that , as the line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line falls .","0"
economic," 5255 . The data in [ link ] is displayed in [ link ] which shows the relationship between two variables : length and median weight for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life .","0"
economic," ( The median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less . )","0"
economic," The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis .","0"
economic," 5258 . A bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities .","1"
economic," [ link ] lists the 12 most populous countries in the world .","0"
economic," 5261 . For example , points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um , which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility .","0"
economic," Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B .","0"
economic," Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same .","1"
economic," 5264 . This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," Along with the budget line are shown the three indifference curves from [ link ] .","0"
economic," What is Lilly ’s utility - maximizing choice ?","0"
economic," 5267 . If oranges get cheaper , people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods .","0"
economic," The income effect refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one ’s income .","1"
economic," If the price of a good that you have been buying falls , then in effect your buying power has risen — you are able to purchase more goods .","0"
economic," 5270 . As explained in Financial Markets , the prices of stocks and bonds depend on future events .","0"
economic," The price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make , including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond .","0"
economic," 5273 . All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers , for managers , and for investors and owners of firms .","0"
economic," The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income ( Y ) .","1"
economic," At some points in the discussion that follows , it will be useful to refer to real GDP as “ national income . ”","0"
economic," Both axes are measured in real ( inflation - adjusted ) terms .","0"
economic," 5276 . The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure - output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule , which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP .","1"
economic," The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line — at point E0 in [ link ] — will show the equilibrium for the economy , because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP .","0"
economic," 5279 . ( Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important , because even low - income societies are not literally at zero income , so the point is hypothetical . )","0"
economic," This relationship between income and consumption , illustrated in [ link ] and [ link ] , is called the consumption function .","1"
economic," 5282 . All the components of aggregate demand — consumption , investment , government spending , and the trade balance — are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram .","0"
economic," [ link ] builds up an aggregate expenditure function , based on the numerical illustrations of C , I , G , X , and M that have been used throughout this text .","0"
economic," 5285 . The meaning of “ equilibrium ” remains the same ; that is , equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome .","1"
economic," To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium , consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E , say point H in [ link ] , where output is higher than the equilibrium .","0"
economic," 5288 . In this way , the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once .","0"
economic," This is called the multiplier effect : An initial increase in spending , cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent .","1"
economic," 5291 . The equilibrium price is $ 80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million .","0"
economic," To see the benefits to consumers , look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left .","0"
economic," This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than $ 80 for a tablet .","0"
economic," 5294 . The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus .","1"
economic," In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium .","0"
economic," The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus .","1"
economic," In [ link ] , social surplus would be shown as the area F + G .","0"
economic," Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity .","0"
economic," 5297 . The new consumer surplus is G , and the new producer surplus is H + I .","0"
economic," In effect , the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus , but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K .","0"
economic," 4312 . Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity .","1"
economic," These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions .","0"
economic," 4315 . Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way .","0"
economic," In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person .","1"
economic," 4321 . How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals ?","0"
economic," Monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank lending , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank .","1"
economic," For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .","0"
economic," 4324 . They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use .","0"
economic," A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other .","1"
economic," The purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and simplify it down to its essentials .","0"
economic," 4327 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .","1"
economic," 4330 . Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very decentralized structure .","0"
economic," A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses .","1"
economic," The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .","0"
economic," 4336 . Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .","1"
economic," Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .","1"
economic," The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .","1"
economic," 4339 . Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired .","1"
economic," The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative .","0"
economic," 4342 . People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide .","0"
economic," Utility , as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices , is subjective but that does not make it less real .","0"
economic," 4345 . Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either .","0"
economic," This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society , using a model called the production possibilities frontier ( PPF ) .","0"
economic," There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice .","0"
economic," 4348 . This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline .","1"
economic," When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large .","0"
economic," 4351 . Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires .","1"
economic," How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics .","0"
economic," 4354 . Rather , it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists .","0"
economic," Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and normative statements , which describe how the world should be .","0"
economic," For example , an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city .","0"
economic," 4357 . But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts , scarcity remains — just at a different level .","0"
economic," The second theme is tradeoffs .","0"
economic," As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good .","0"
economic," 4360 . Finally , the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices .","0"
economic," An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today .","0"
economic," 4363 . Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .","1"
economic," The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .","1"
economic," The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price .","1"
economic," Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .","0"
economic," 4366 . An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .","1"
economic," Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .","1"
economic," Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .","1"
economic," 4369 . Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .","0"
economic," Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve .","0"
economic," 4372 . Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity .","1"
economic," While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves .","0"
economic," 4375 . The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices .","0"
economic," The analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence .","1"
economic," Typically , the incidence , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good .","0"
economic," 4378 . The cross - price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas .","0"
economic," The term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good .","1"
economic," 4381 . Let ’s define what is meant by the firm .","0"
economic," A firm ( or business ) combines inputs of labor , capital , land , and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs .","1"
economic," If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .","0"
economic," 4384 . We can distinguish between two types of cost : explicit and implicit .","0"
economic," Explicit costs are out - of - pocket costs , that is , payments that are actually made .","1"
economic," Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .","0"
economic," 4387 . It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .","0"
economic," Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and implicit costs .","1"
economic," The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit .","0"
economic," 4390 . Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term .","1"
economic," Whether you produce a lot or a little , the fixed costs are the same .","0"
economic," 4393 . Average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output .","1"
economic," Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut .","0"
economic," 4402 . Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well .","1"
economic," This situation is called diseconomies of scale .","0"
economic," A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials .","0"
economic," 4405 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .","1"
economic," The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .","1"
economic," 4411 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .","1"
economic," Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .","1"
economic," A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .","0"
economic," 4414 . Like demand , supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph .","0"
economic," A supply schedule is a table , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices .","1"
economic," Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .","0"
economic," 4417 . The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .","1"
economic," The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .","1"
economic," 4420 . When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price .","1"
economic," In this situation , eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of fuel .","0"
economic," 4423 . The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .","1"
economic," Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus , a Latin phrase meaning “ other things being equal . ”","0"
economic," Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal .","0"
economic," A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables when all other variables are kept constant .","0"
economic," 4426 . The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising .","0"
economic," It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 .","0"
economic," 4429 . These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve .","0"
economic," Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price .","0"
economic," The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens .","0"
economic," 4432 . For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years .","0"
economic," A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right .","0"
economic," When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well .","0"
economic," For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice .","0"
economic," 4435 . “ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) .","0"
economic," So the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher .","0"
economic," Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 .","0"
economic," 4438 . The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be .","0"
economic," According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 .","0"
economic," [ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe .","0"
economic," In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 .","0"
economic," 4441 . At that above - equilibrium salary , excess supply or a surplus results .","0"
economic," In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have .","0"
economic," Nurses ’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises .","0"
economic," 4444 . In mid- 2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .","0"
economic," Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage .","0"
economic," Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living .","0"
economic," 4447 . The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets .","0"
economic," According to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded .","1"
economic," As the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow .","0"
economic," 4450 . Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits .","0"
economic," The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models .","0"
economic," 4453 . To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices .","0"
economic," In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis .","1"
economic," 4456 . The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate .","0"
economic," The third column shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption .","1"
economic," This equation for marginal utility is : MU = change in total utility change in quantity MU = change in total utility change in quantity","0"
economic," Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed , which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility .","0"
economic," 4459 . This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility .","0"
economic," Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie .","0"
economic," 4462 . How does this rise in income alter her utility - maximizing choice ?","0"
economic," Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line .","0"
economic," But how will her new choice relate to her original choice ?","0"
economic," 4465 . This occurs for two reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously .","0"
economic," The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .","1"
economic," The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .","1"
economic," 4468 . Again , let ’s proceed with a concrete example .","0"
economic," The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint .","0"
economic," 4471 . [ link ] and [ link ] show Yelberton ’s intertemporal budget constraint .","0"
economic," Yelberton ’s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement .","0"
economic," 4474 . And what ’s more , actions under these conditions are indeed predictable , if the underlying environment is better understood .","0"
economic," So , behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision - making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics .","1"
economic," It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation .","0"
economic," 4477 . Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold .","1"
economic," This is referred to as the market structure of the industry .","0"
economic," In this chapter , we focus on perfect competition .","0"
economic," 4480 . A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make — namely , what quantity to produce .","0"
economic," To understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit :","0"
economic," 4483 . In this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ 4 and a quantity of 80 produced .","0"
economic," If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise .","0"
economic," 4486 . No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price .","0"
economic," However , the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market .","0"
economic," 4489 . For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before .","1"
economic," Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor .","0"
economic," 4492 . To explore what is meant by allocative efficiency , it is useful to walk through an example .","0"
economic," Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive , and so P = MC .","0"
economic," 4495 . There are two types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit .","0"
economic," One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .","1"
economic," The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .","1"
economic," 4498 . Copyright Office .","0"
economic," A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years .","1"
economic," The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires .","0"
economic," 4501 . But in certain areas , like the invention of new software , it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply .","0"
economic," There is also a body of law known as trade secrets .","0"
economic," Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention , competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets .","0"
economic," 4504 . Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market .","0"
economic," One method is known as predatory pricing , in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition .","1"
economic," Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law , but it is difficult to prove .","0"
economic," 4507 . For a perfect competitor , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price .","0"
economic," But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue .","0"
economic," When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price .","0"
economic," 4510 . A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price takers in the face of the competition .","0"
economic," If you recall , price takers are firms that have no market power .","1"
economic," They simply have to take the market price as given .","0"
economic," 4513 . Crew , and Nordstrom ’s ) , plus 14 more stores that sold women ’s specialty clothing ( like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria ’s Secret ) .","0"
economic," Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive .","0"
economic," The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly .","0"
economic," Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms .","1"
economic," 4516 . Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product .","0"
economic," Finally , product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers .","0"
economic," For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands .","0"
economic," 4519 . Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering .","0"
economic," First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces .","0"
economic," Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products .","0"
economic," 4522 . Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run .","0"
economic," Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit .","0"
economic," A zero economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use .","1"
economic," 4525 . Rather , they are oligopolies .","0"
economic," Oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry .","1"
economic," Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry , cable television , and commercial air travel .","0"
economic," 4528 . By acting together , oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves .","0"
economic," When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .","1"
economic," A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .","1"
economic," 4531 . The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists .","0"
economic," Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”","0"
economic," 4534 . Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits .","0"
economic," [ link ] shows the prisoner ’s dilemma for a two - firm oligopoly — known as a duopoly .","1"
economic," If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ 1,000 in profits .","0"
economic," 4537 . One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases .","1"
economic," This situation is shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," 4540 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .","0"
economic," When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .","1"
economic," 4543 . In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm .","1"
economic," Thus , when the U.S. government passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts , it was called an antitrust law .","0"
economic," In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .","0"
economic," 4546 . Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry .","0"
economic," An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .","1"
economic," For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly .","0"
economic," Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .","1"
economic," 4549 . Defining a market is often controversial .","0"
economic," For example , Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems .","0"
economic," 4552 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .","1"
economic," Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .","0"
economic," 4555 . Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product .","1"
economic," Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need .","0"
economic," 4558 . All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s .","0"
economic," Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care .","0"
economic," 4561 . The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest .","0"
economic," Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point .","0"
economic," This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A .","0"
economic," 4564 . Beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well .","0"
economic," The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates .","1"
economic," The Clear it Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular — airlines .","0"
economic," What are the results of airline deregulation ?","0"
economic," 4567 . The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , a major investment bank , numerous large commercial banks , such as Wachovia , and even the Federal National Mortgage Corporation ( Fannie Mae ) , which had to be nationalized — that is , taken over by the federal government .","1"
economic," One response to the financial crisis was the Dodd - Frank Act , which attempted major reforms of the financial system .","0"
economic," The legislation ’s purpose , as noted on dodd-frank.com is :","0"
economic," 4570 . The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .","1"
economic," Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .","0"
economic," If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .","0"
economic," 4573 . Pollution is a negative externality .","0"
economic," Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram .","0"
economic," The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society .","1"
economic," 4576 . However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs .","0"
economic," Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure .","0"
economic," When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) .","1"
economic," 4579 . In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .","0"
economic," Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .","0"
economic," These command - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and updates , have been largely responsible for America ’s cleaner air and water in recent decades .","0"
economic," 4582 . When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program ( e.g. cap - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards .","0"
economic," 4585 . However , it also found that a middle - range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $ 22 trillion — about 44 times higher than the costs .","0"
economic," A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one .","0"
economic," The EPA estimated that “ in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $ 110 billion .","0"
economic," 4588 . However , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more costly methods must be used .","0"
economic," The marginal cost curve rises .","0"
economic," Also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits .","0"
economic," 4591 . However , low - income countries , with some understandable exasperation , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth .","0"
economic," After all , high - income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels — and still are today .","0"
economic," It is hard to tell people who are living in a low - income country , where adequate diet , health care , and education are lacking , that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment .","0"
economic," 4594 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .","1"
economic," However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .","0"
economic," 4597 . In certain cases , however , competition can discourage new technology , especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea .","0"
economic," Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug .","0"
economic," 4600 . However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .","0"
economic," The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .","1"
economic," As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .","1"
economic," 4603 . Data in [ link ] , from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers , Third Quarter 2014 , demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education .","0"
economic," While these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts , the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker , so these returns are private rates of return to education .","0"
economic," The first row is a header row and it labels the last three columns , ' Less than a High School Degree , ' ' High School Degree , No College , ' and ' Bachelor 's Degree . '","0"
economic," 4606 . One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or process .","0"
economic," Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .","1"
economic," For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .","0"
economic," 4609 . For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ”","1"

economic," Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .","0"
economic," The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity .","0"
economic," 4612 . Instead , public goods have two defining characteristics : they are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous .","0"
economic," The first characteristic , that a public good is nonexcludable , means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good .","1"
economic," If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza , then he can exclude others , like Lorna , from eating that pizza .","0"
economic," 4615 . Goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous are called common resources .","1"

economic," One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets .","0"
economic," We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States .","0"
economic," Measuring Income Distribution by QuintilesOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles .","1"
economic," 4642 . The programs are paid for through the federal income tax , which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor .","1"
economic," Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .","0"
economic," 4645 . The United States does have an estate tax — that is , a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance — which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance .","1"
economic," However , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $ 5.43 million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth .","0"
economic," 4648 . What are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive ?","0"
economic," To analyze these questions , let ’s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union , and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor .","0"
economic," If no labor union existed in this market , then equilibrium ( E ) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor ( D ) and the supply of labor ( S ) in [ link ] .","0"
economic," 4651 . In the past , presidential use of the Taft - Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but , in this case , it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement . In other instances , unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies .","0"
economic," In one prominent example , during the 1950s and 1960s , the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor - saving machinery in the mines .","0"
economic," The mineworkers ’ union realized that over time , the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines , but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive , and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity .","0"
economic," 4654 . Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor such as race , gender , or religion .","1"
economic," There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets , which arises if workers with the same skill levels — as measured by education , experience , and expertise — receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender .","0"
economic," 4657 . If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on their productivity , then other profit - seeking employers can hire these workers .","0"
economic," In a competitive market , if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin , they will have an incentive to make buying , selling , hiring , and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors .","0"
economic," 4663 . Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns .","0"
economic," Those who express concern about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics like [ link ] which shows total inflows of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century .","0"
economic," Clearly , the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years , reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth century .","0"
economic," 4666 . The general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be revealed , but often disclosure is not made .","0"
economic," As such , many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information , where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information ( one party knows much more than the other ) .","1"
economic," 4669 . For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product ’s price and quality .","0"
economic," If there is limited information , then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions .","0"
economic," 4672 . When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products , then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity .","0"
economic," Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling , and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity .","0"
economic," 4675 . In the goods market , the seller of a good might offer a money - back guarantee , an agreement that functions as a promise of quality .","1"
economic," This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail - order catalogs or over the web , whose customers can not see the actual products , because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it .","0"
economic," 4678 . Sellers of labor provide information through resumes , recommendations , school transcripts , and examples of their work .","0"
economic," Occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market .","0"
economic," Occupational licenses , which are typically issued by government agencies , show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test .","1"
economic," 4681 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .","0"
economic," Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .","1"
economic," Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .","1"
economic," 4687 . Pension insurance : Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised .","1"
economic," 4690 . Retirement insurance : All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare , which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly .","1"
economic," Social Security and Medicare are not literally “ insurance ” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits .","0"
economic," 4693 . Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs .","0"
economic," For example , insurance policies often have deductibles , which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying .","1"
economic," For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .","0"
economic," 4696 . A final way of reducing moral hazard , which is especially applicable to health care , is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care , rather than consumers .","0"
economic," Traditionally , most health care in the United States has been provided on a fee - for - service basis , which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services .","1"
economic," However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .","0"
economic," 4702 . The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) will be funded through additional taxes to include :","0"
economic," 4705 . Firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future .","0"
economic," Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years , or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years , or starts a research and development project .","0"
economic," Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways : ( 1 ) from early - stage investors ; ( 2 ) by reinvesting profits ; ( 3 ) by borrowing through banks or bonds ; and ( 4 ) by selling stock .","0"
economic," 4711 . In this way , an individual investor could , in effect , loan the firm $ 5,000 , or any multiple of that amount .","0"
economic," Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder .","1"
economic," If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments , the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment .","0"
economic," 4714 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .","0"
economic," Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .","1"
economic," The stock of a company is divided into shares .","0"
economic," 4717 . That rate of return can come in two forms .","0"
economic," A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders , called a dividend .","1"
economic," Alternatively , a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal - Mart for $ 45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ 60 , for a gain of $ 15 .","0"
economic," 4720 . A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .","0"
economic," A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .","1"
economic," A private company can also be a corporation , but with no publicly issued stock .","0"
economic," 4726 . A high - risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years .","0"
economic," The actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return , including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time .","1"
economic," 4729 . A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .","1"
economic," A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .","1"
economic," The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades , as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account , or conversely , offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month .","0"
economic," 4732 . Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds .","0"
economic," Bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds .","1"
economic," A number of today ’s well - known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow , including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft .","0"
economic," 4735 . ( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . )","0"
economic," The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .","1"
economic," Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .","0"
economic," 4738 . [ link ] shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds : 10- year Treasury bonds ( which are officially called “ notes ” ) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by Moody ’s , an independent firm that publishes such ratings .","0"
economic," Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate , because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government , the rates tend to rise and fall together .","0"
economic," 4741 . Purchasing a diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the Internet age , but it remains something of a task .","0"
economic," To simplify the process , companies offer mutual funds , which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies .","1"
economic," The financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund , and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs .","0"
economic," 4744 . The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing .","0"
economic," Thus , in attempting to get rich in the stock market , it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion , because the stock price will already be high , based on the expected high level of future profits . The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication .","0"
economic," 4750 . For example , many U.S. drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made — they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it .","0"
economic," In September 2009 , President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff ( taxes added on imported goods ) on tires imported from China that would increase the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year , 30 percent in its second year , and 25 percent in its third year .","1"
economic," Interestingly , the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step , because most of them also import tires from China and other countries .","0"
economic," 4753 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .","0"
economic," In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .","0"
economic," They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording .","0"
economic," 4759 . Politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district , where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way .","0"
economic," Thus , when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation , they commonly ask each other to include pork - barrel spending , legislation that benefits mainly a single political district .","1"
economic," Pork - barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs : the benefits of pork - barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters , while the costs are spread over the entire country .","0"
economic," 4762 . Does the majority view prevail in the case of sugar quotas ?","0"
economic," Clearly there are more sugar consumers in the United States than sugar producers , but the U.S. domestic sugar lobby ( www.sugarcane.org ) has successfully argued for protection against imports since 1789 .","0"
economic," 4765 . When a firm produces a product no one wants to buy or produces at a higher cost than its competitors , the firm is likely to suffer losses .","0"
economic," If it can not change its ways , it will go out of business .","0"
economic," 4768 . As you learn in the micro part of this book , principal tools used by economists are theories and models ( see Welcome to Economics !","0"
economic," for more on this ) .","0"
economic," In microeconomics , we used the theories of supply and demand ; in macroeconomics , we use the theories of aggregate demand ( AD ) and aggregate supply ( AS ) .","0"
economic," This book presents two perspectives on macroeconomics : the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective , each of which has its own version of AD and AS .","0"
economic," 4771 . Investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment , primarily by businesses .","1"
economic," If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .","0"
economic," 4777 . Everything that is purchased must be produced first .","0"
economic," [ link ] breaks down what is produced into five categories : durable goods , nondurable goods , services , structures , and the change in inventories .","0"
economic," Before going into detail about these categories , notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand .","0"
economic," 4783 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .","1"
economic," The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .","1"
economic," The NNP can be further subdivided into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people .","1"
economic," 4786 . The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .","1"
economic," The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .","1"
economic," Generally , it is the real value that is more important .","0"
economic," 4789 . Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .","0"
economic," However , over time , the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP ( that is , the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line ) , because the rise in nominal GDP is exaggerated by the presence of inflation , especially in the 1970s . U.S .","0"

economic," The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008 – 2009 .","0"
economic," 4795 . A private think tank , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) , is the official tracker of business cycles for the U.S. economy .","0"

economic," Key Concepts and Summary","0"
economic," 4798 . So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries , or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per - person basis ?","0"
economic," This question can be answered by calculating a country ’s GDP per capita ; that is , the GDP divided by the population .","1"
economic," 4801 . GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society .","0"
economic," GDP per capita is only an average .","0"
economic," When GDP per capita rises by 5 % , it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5 % , or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less — or even declined .","0"
economic," 4804 . According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .","0"
economic," The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .","1"
economic," Ingenious machines — the steam engine , the power loom , and the steam locomotive — performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do .","0"
economic," 4807 . In other words , how efficient is your nation with its time and workers ?","0"
economic," Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input .","1"
economic," The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread .","0"
economic," 4810 . To analyze the sources of economic growth , it is useful to think about a production function , which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor , machinery , and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers .","1"
economic," A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .","0"
economic," 4813 . It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time .","0"
economic," Similarly , compound rates of economic growth , or the compound growth rate , means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth , with dramatic effects over time .","1"
economic," 4816 . It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say , Benin , simply because of the great difference in population size .","0"
economic," To understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita .","0"
economic," Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people , like Belgium , Uruguay , or Zimbabwe , with countries that have larger populations , like the United States , the Russian Federation , or Nigeria .","0"
economic," 4819 . Special Economic Zones .","0"
economic," The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government - supported special economic zones ( SEZ ) .","0"
economic," These are areas of the country , usually with access to a port where , among other benefits , the government does not tax trade .","1"
economic," 4822 . A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns .","0"
economic," Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita , the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital , the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish .","1"
economic," For example , raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth - grade level to a high school diploma ( while holding all other inputs constant ) would produce a certain increase in output .","0"
economic," 4825 . An economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory .","0"
economic," The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers .","0"
economic," 4828 . They are , however , also counted in the employed group .","0"
economic," All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term “ hidden unemployment . ” Discouraged workers , those who have stopped looking for employment and , hence , are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group","1"
economic," 4831 . The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy .","0"
economic," During periods of recession and depression , unemployment is high .","0"
economic," During periods of economic growth , unemployment tends to be lower .","0"
economic," 4834 . The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion ( i.e .","1"
economic," the business cycle ) is known as cyclical unemployment .","0"
economic," 4837 . One set of reasons why wages may be “ sticky downward , ” as economists put it , involves economic laws and institutions .","0"
economic," For low - skilled workers being paid the minimum wage , it is illegal to reduce their wages .","0"
economic," For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company , wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike .","0"
economic," 4840 . Efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate .","1"
economic," One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would suffer a decline in salary .","0"
economic," 4843 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ”","1"
economic," A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .","0"
economic," However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects .","0"
economic," Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .","1"
economic," Instead , workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others .","0"
economic," 4846 . But in the real world , even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job .","0"
economic," The unemployment that occurs in the meantime , as workers move between jobs , is called frictional unemployment .","1"
economic," Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing .","0"
economic," 4849 . Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy .","1"
economic," Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices .","0"
economic," 4852 . To calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy .","0"
economic," The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time .","0"
economic," 4855 . Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .","1"
economic," To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number , economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices .","0"
economic," The base year , by definition , has an index number equal to 100 .","0"
economic," 4858 . A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption .","0"
economic," Thus , substitution bias — the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time — tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen .","1"
economic," 4861 . The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods .","0"
economic," For example , the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services .","1"
economic," It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .","0"
economic," 4864 . An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .","0"
economic," The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .","1"
economic," Unlike the CPI , its baskets are not fixed but re - calculate what that year ’s GDP would have been worth using the base - year ’s prices .","0"
economic," 4867 . Inflation in China averaged about 10 % per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , although it has dropped off since then .","0"
economic," Russia experienced hyperinflation — an outburst of high inflation — of 2,500 % per year in the early 1990s , although by 2006 Russia ’s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10 % per year , as shown in [ link ] .","1"
economic," The closest the United States has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the Civil War , 1860 – 1865 , in the Confederate states .","0"
economic," Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates , 1980 – 2013","0"
economic," These charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year ’s consumer prices in Brazil , China , and Russia .","0"
economic," 4870 . Economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation .","0"
economic," If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .","0"
economic," 4873 . Moreover , the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful , prolonged conflicts between employers and employees .","0"
economic," If the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently , minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages , as shown in [ link ] .","0"
economic," U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation , the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010 , even though the nominal figure climbed from $ 1.40 to $ 7.25 per hour .","0"
economic," 4876 . Prices are the messengers in a market economy , conveying information about conditions of demand and supply .","0"
economic," Inflation blurs those price messages .","0"
economic," 4879 . Second , an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible .","0"
economic," The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result .","0"
economic," 4882 . In the 1970s and 1980s , labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost - of - living adjustments ( COLAs ) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation .","1"
economic," These contracts were sometimes written as , for example , COLA plus 3 % .","0"
economic," 4885 . Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount — $ 117,000 in 2014 .","0"
economic," This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation , so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base .","0"
economic," As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing , in 1996 the U.S. , government began offering indexed bonds .","0"
economic," Bonds are means by which the U.S. government ( and many private - sector companies as well ) borrows money ; that is , investors buy the bonds , and then the government repays the money with interest .","1"
economic," 4888 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .","0"
economic," If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .","1"
economic," If exports and imports are equal , then trade is balanced .","0"
economic," 4891 . Old habits are hard to break .","0"
economic," Economists , however , typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid .","0"
economic," 4894 . The second row of [ link ] provides data on trade in services .","0"
economic," Here , the U.S. economy is running a surplus .","0"
economic," Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .","0"

economic," The first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy : exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP .","0"
economic," The second column shows the trade balance .","0"
economic," 4900 . The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments .","0"
economic," Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy .","0"
economic," 4903 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .","0"
economic," In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .","0"
economic," What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital ?","0"
economic," 4906 . For most years of the nineteenth century , U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit .","0"
economic," Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all ; instead , the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900 .","0"
economic," 4909 . The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade .","0"
economic," The United States has a low level of trade , but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid- 1980s into the 2000s .","0"
economic," 4912 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767 – 1832 ) .","0"
economic," Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ”","0"
economic," As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view .","0"
economic," The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .","1"
economic," 4915 . To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .","0"
economic," Nevertheless , a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes .","0"
economic," A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size , business failures outnumber the remaining success stories , and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers .","1"
economic," Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run .","0"
economic," 4918 . To build a useful macroeconomic model , we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy , and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level .","1"
economic," This model is called the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model .","0"
economic," This module will explain aggregate supply , aggregate demand , and the equilibrium between them .","0"
economic," 4921 . If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production . The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right .","0"
economic," At the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP , which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions .","1"
economic," At these relatively low levels of output , levels of unemployment are high , and many factories are running only part - time , or have closed their doors .","0"
economic," 4924 . This demand is determined by a number of factors , but one of them is the price level — recall though , that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy .","1"
economic," The aggregate demand ( AD ) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level .","1"
economic," [ link ] presents an aggregate demand ( AD ) curve .","0"
economic," Just like the aggregate supply curve , the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level .","0"
economic," 4927 . In the long run , however , producers are limited to producing at potential GDP .","0"
economic," For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .","0"
economic," The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .","0"
economic," 4930 . Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .","1"
economic," One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita .","0"
economic," Over time , productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output .","0"
economic," 4933 . The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month .","0"
economic," The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu , which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels .","0"
economic," 4939 . The AD / AS model can be used to illustrate both Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes ’ law that demand creates its own supply .","0"
economic," Consider the three zones of the SRAS curve as identified in [ link ] : the Keynesian zone , the neoclassical zone , and the intermediate zone . Keynes , Neoclassical , and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply CurveNear the equilibrium Ek , in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve , small shifts in AD , either to the right or the left , will affect the output level Yk , but will not much affect the price level .","0"
economic," 4942 . Finally , consider the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve in [ link ] .","0"
economic," If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei , then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions .","0"
economic," 4945 . The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .","0"
economic," Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap , with its attendant unemployment , for a significant period of time .","0"
economic," In the same way ( though not shown in the figure ) , if AD increases , the economy could experience an inflationary gap , where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output .","1"
economic," As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .","0"
economic," 4948 . Disposable income : For most people , the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take - home pay , also known as disposable income , which is income after taxes .","1"
economic," 4954 . Instead , prices and wages are “ sticky , ” making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP .","0"
economic," Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky : the coordination argument .","0"
economic," This argument points out that , even if most people would be willing — at least hypothetically — to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline , a market - oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions .","1"
economic," 4957 . A key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier .","0"
economic," The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP , but that spending is powerful .","1"
economic," 4960 . The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP , the economy is at greater risk for inflation .","0"
economic," Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation , which became known as a Phillips curve .","1"
economic," [ link ] shows a theoretical Phillips curve , and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States .","0"
economic," 4963 . Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right .","1"
economic," For example , if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in [ link ] , so that the economy was in recession , the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf , where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment .","0"
economic," 4969 . This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .","0"
economic," Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model .","0"
economic," The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run","0"
economic," 4975 . One subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed .","0"
economic," The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can , using all information available to them .","1"
economic," In an economy where most people have rational expectations , economic adjustments may happen very quickly .","0"
economic," 4978 . As inflation fluctuates , so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods .","0"
economic," The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate , plus an expected inflation factor .","1"
economic," Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy .","0"
economic," 4981 . Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?As explained in Unemployment , unemployment can be divided into two categories : cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment , which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment .","1"
economic," Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP — giving potential employers less incentive to hire .","1"
economic," 4984 . Each approach , Keynesian and neoclassical , has its strengths and weaknesses . The short - term Keynesian model , built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity , does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls .","1"
economic," By focusing on the short - run adjustments of aggregate demand , Keynesian economics risks overlooking the long - term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP .","0"
economic," 4987 . The discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of macroeconomics .","0"
economic," At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !","0"
economic," : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .","0"
economic," We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .","0"
economic," 4990 . Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .","1"
economic," In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .","1"
economic," For example , if an accountant wants a pair of shoes , this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services .","0"
economic," 4993 . This function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value .","0"
economic," In an economy with inflation , money loses some buying power each year , but it remains money . Third , money serves as a unit of account , which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured .","0"
economic," For example , an accountant may charge $ 100 to file your tax return .","0"
economic," 4996 . Gold , silver , cowrie shells , cigarettes , and even cocoa beans have been used as money .","0"
economic," Although these items are used as commodity money , they also have a value from use as something other than money .","0"
economic," Gold , for example , has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes .","0"
economic," 4999 . Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money , economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity .","0"
economic," Liquidity refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service .","1"
economic," For example , cash is very liquid .","0"
economic," 5002 . M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds .","1"
economic," M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .","1"
economic," Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .","0"
economic," These are the amounts held in checking accounts .","1"
economic," 5005 . Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .","1"
economic," Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .","1"
economic," In short , all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend , but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1 [ link ] should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2 .","0"
economic," 5008 . Until you pay the credit card bill , you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company .","0"
economic," With a smart card , you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases .","0"
economic," Some “ smart cards ” used for specific purposes , like long - distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria , are not really all that smart , because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places . In short , credit cards , debit cards , and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made .","0"
economic," 5011 . Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .","0"
economic," Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money .","1"
economic," Thus , banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries — they bring savers and borrowers together .","0"
economic," 5014 . A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run .","1"
economic," Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member .","0"

economic," A liability is a debt or something you owe .","1"
economic," Many people borrow money to buy homes .","0"
economic," 5020 . [ link ] illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank .","0"
economic," Because of the two - column format of the balance sheet , with the T - shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “ Assets ” and “ Liabilities , ” it is sometimes called a T - account .","0"
economic," 5023 . These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset : The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future .","0"
economic," In our example , the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $ 4 million .","0"
economic," The final entry under assets is reserves , which is money that the bank keeps on hand , and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds — and thus does not lead to interest payments .","1"
economic," The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors ’ money on “ reserve , ” which means either in their vaults or kept at the Federal Reserve Bank .","0"
economic," 5026 . The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank ’s liabilities , namely the deposits of its customers , can be withdrawn quickly , but many of the bank ’s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades .","0"
economic," This asset - liability time mismatch — a bank ’s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term — can cause severe problems for a bank .","0"
economic," For example , imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate , but then sees interest rates rise substantially .","0"
economic," 5029 . In making decisions about the money supply , a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and , in this way , to influence macroeconomic policy , whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation .","1"
economic," The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation ’s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank ’s balance sheet .","0"
economic," 5032 . The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors .","0"
economic," In early 2014 , Janet L. Yellen , shown in [ link ] became the first woman to hold this post .","0"
economic," Yellen has been described in the media as “ perhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history . ”","0"
economic," With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University , Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard , the London School of Economics , and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley .","0"
economic," 5035 . Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .","0"
economic," In Money and Banking , we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves .","0"
economic," “ On hand ” is a bit of a misnomer because , while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank , the majority are held in the bank ’s account at the Federal Reserve , and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors .","0"
economic," 5038 . The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) supervises credit unions , which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members .","1"
economic," There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy , though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks .","0"
economic," The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions .","0"
economic," 5041 . To protect against bank runs , Congress has put two strategies into place : deposit insurance and the lender of last resort .","0"
economic," Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money , even if the bank goes bankrupt .","1"
economic," 5044 . The most important function of the Federal Reserve is to conduct the nation ’s monetary policy .","0"
economic," Article I , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “ to coin money ” and “ to regulate the value thereof . ”","0"
economic," As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve , Congress delegated these powers to the Fed .","0"
economic," 5047 . Where did the Federal Reserve get the $ 20 million that it used to purchase the bonds ?","0"
economic," A central bank has the power to create money .","0"
economic," 5050 . As a result of the Panic , the Federal Reserve was founded to be the “ lender of last resort . ”","0"
economic," In the event of a bank run , sound banks , ( banks that were not bankrupt ) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed ’s discount “ window ” to quell the bank run . The interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the discount rate .","1"
economic," ( They are so named because loans are made against the bank ’s outstanding loans “ at a discount ” of their face value . )","0"
economic," 5053 . Recall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the federal funds rate .","1"
economic," The Federal Reserve has , since 1995 , established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations .","0"
economic," 5056 . [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .","0"
economic," This example uses a short - run upward - sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve ( SRAS ) .","0"
economic," The original equilibrium during a recession of E0 occurs at an output level of 600 .","0"
economic," 5059 . In late 2008 , as the U.S. economy struggled with recession , the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near - zero .","0"
economic," With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .","0"
economic," This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .","1"
economic," 5065 . Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms ’ sales and employees ’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .","0"
economic," The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .","0"
economic," 5068 . Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative ; that is , instead of money having less purchasing power over time , as occurs with inflation , money is worth more .","1"
economic," Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession .","0"
economic," 5071 . If velocity is constant over time , then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left - hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP — although this change could happen through an increase in inflation , or an increase in real GDP , or some combination of the two .","0"
economic," If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way , then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP .","0"
economic," 5077 . By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .","0"
economic," A notable exception is the Federal Reserve in the United States , which does not practice inflation - targeting .","0"
economic," Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .","0"
economic," 5080 . For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .","0"
economic," The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .","0"
economic," These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable .","0"

With these exceptions duly noted , most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling , buying , hiring , borrowing , traveling , or investing across national borders .","0"
economic," The market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency is called the foreign exchange market .","1"
economic," 5089 . Financial investments that cross international boundaries , and require exchanging currency , are often divided into two categories .","0"
economic," Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) refers to purchasing a firm ( at least ten percent ) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country","1"
economic," For example , in 2008 the Belgian beer - brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer - maker Anheuser - Busch for $ 52 billion .","0"
economic," To make this purchase of a U.S. firm , InBev would have to supply euros ( the currency of Belgium ) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars .","0"
economic," 5092 . Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank , and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers .","1"
economic," These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .","0"
economic," This is called the interbank market .","0"
economic," 5095 . This means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries ( in this case , the United States and Canada ) , the depreciation ( or weakening ) of one country ( the U.S. dollar for this example ) indicates the appreciation ( or strengthening ) of the other currency ( which in this example is the Canadian dollar ) .","1"
economic," ( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) ( a ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCAUS ; ( b ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CCUSSP01CAQ650N ) The bottom graph shows the exchange rate from U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars since 1980 .","0"
economic," 5104 . This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm , because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country .","0"
economic," From the point of view of the U.S. economy , the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages exports .","0"
economic," 5110 . Exchange rates would bounce around less , too .","0"
economic," The economist Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) , for example , wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in 1962 in his book Capitalism and Freedom : Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates .","0"
economic," When we support a free price system [ for goods and services ] at home , this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down .","0"
economic," 5113 . The Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways .","0"
economic," One approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates .","0"
economic," In foreign exchange markets , the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation .","0"
economic," 5116 . When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate , it faces a number of tradeoffs .","0"
economic," If it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate , it then can not at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession .","0"
economic," If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates , then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency .","0"
economic," 5119 . If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .","0"
economic," Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .","0"
economic," 5122 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .","1"
economic," For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .","0"
economic," Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country .","0"
economic," 5125 . The choice depends both on how well a nation ’s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation ’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies .","0"
economic," A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth , low inflation , low unemployment , and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy ; conversely , no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals .","0"
economic," On the other hand , a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems , such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies .","0"
economic," 5128 . Government spending covers a range of services provided by the federal , state , and local governments .","0"
economic," When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .","1"
economic," Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .","1"
economic," 5134 . Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .","0"
economic," The marginal tax rates ( the tax that must be paid on all yearly income ) for a single taxpayer range from 10 % to 35 % , depending on income , as the following Clear It Up feature explains .","1"
economic," 5137 . The third - largest source of federal tax revenue , as shown in [ link ] is the corporate income tax .","0"
economic," The common name for corporate income is “ profits . ” Over time , corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP , from about 4 % in the 1960s to an average of 1 % to 2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .","0"
economic," 5140 . Having discussed the revenue ( taxes ) and expense ( spending ) side of the budget , we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus , which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year , which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year .","0"
economic," 5149 . Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates , fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected .","0"
economic," This is referred to as crowding out , where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates , which reduces business investment and household consumption .","1"
economic," 5152 . Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .","0"
economic," The time to get the projects started is often called the implementation lag .","1"
economic," 5161 . At this point , you may wonder about the Federal Reserve .","0"
economic," After all , can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates , or in this case , to prevent interest rates from rising ?","0"
economic," 5164 . Other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K–12 education system .","0"
economic," Programs for early childhood education , like the federal Head Start program , are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources .","0"
economic," Government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges .","0"
economic," 5167 . If the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors , then a budget deficit may be accompanied by a trade deficit .","0"
economic," In some countries , this pattern of a twin deficits has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well .","0"
economic," It depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors .","0"
economic," 5173 . The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well - being , substantial though they are , do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries .","0"
economic," Aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth , four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning : geography , demography , industrial structure , and institutions .","0"
economic," Geographic and Demographic Differences","0"
economic," 5176 . This combination of technology , human capital , and physical capital , combined with the incentives of a market - oriented economic context , proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth .","0"
economic," Challenges faced by these middle - income countries are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over time .","0"
economic," 5182 . Unemployment rates in the nations of Europe have typically been higher than in the United States .","0"
economic," In 2006 , before the start of the Great Recession , the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.6 % , compared with 9 % in France , 10.4 % in Germany , and 7.1 % in Sweden .","0"
economic," The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe , which dates back to the 1970s , is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs .","0"
economic," Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice .","0"
economic," 5185 . The economies of Europe thrive with high levels of trade .","0"
economic," In the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the United States , Canada , and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers .","1"
economic," Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy .","0"
economic," 5188 . In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .","0"
economic," A trade surplus , you may remember , exists when a nation ’s exports exceed its imports .","1"
economic," So , in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade surplus , a nation ’s exports must rise and its imports must fall .","0"
economic," 5197 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .","1"
economic," The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ”","0"
economic," It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .","0"
economic," For example , if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper , its labor , land and financial resources can not be used to produce other goods such as corn .","0"
economic," 5200 . Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .","0"
economic," With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .","0"
economic," ( Recall that the chapter","0"
economic," 5203 . If Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade , it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production .","0"
economic," If Mexico , instead , produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States , where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower , Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States .","0"
economic," Conversely , when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico , international trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico .","0"
economic," 5212 . Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .","0"
economic," The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) is committed to lowering barriers to trade .","0"
economic," The world ’s nations meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade , such as tariffs .","0"
economic," 5215 . They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .","0"
economic," For example , in recent years large , flat - screen televisions imported from China have faced a 5 % tariff rate . Another way to control trade is through import quotas , which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products that can be imported .","1"
economic," For instance , during the early 1980s , the Reagan Administration imposed a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles .","0"
economic," 5218 . Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar , as detailed in [ link ] and illustrated in [ link ] .","0"
economic," In Brazil , without trade , the equilibrium price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons .","0"
economic," When there is no trade in the United States , the equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80 tons .","0"
economic," 5224 . Now , let ’s look at what happens with protectionism .","0"
economic," U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that , if only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil , the United States would have higher domestic sugar production , more jobs in the sugar industry , and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price .","0"
economic," 5227 . While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , from spring 2008 to late 2009 , the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 % to 10 % ; it has since fallen back to 5.5 % in spring 2015 — the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time .","0"
economic," The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012 .","0"
economic," Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but , for two reasons , it costs jobs in other unprotected industries .","0"
economic," First , if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry , they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries , and so jobs are lost in those other industries .","0"
economic," 5230 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .","0"
economic," After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .","0"
economic," Meanwhile , low - skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low - wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing .","0"
economic," 5233 . Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .","1"
economic," Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .","1"
economic," 5236 . If free trade meant the destruction of life itself , then even economists would convert to protectionism !","0"
economic," While globalization — and economic activity of all kinds — can pose environmental dangers , it seems quite possible that , with the appropriate safeguards in place , the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized .","0"
economic," 5239 . The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this .","0"
economic," Profit - seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards , thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits .","0"
economic," 5242 . The United Nations was unable to agree to this .","0"
economic," Instead , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , was established in 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade .","1"
economic," In 1995 , the GATT was transformed into the WTO .","0"
economic," 5245 . For the United States , perhaps the best - known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .","0"
economic," The United States also participates in some less - prominent regional trading agreements , like the Caribbean Basin Initiative , which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries , and a free trade agreement with Israel .","1"
economic," 5248 . What is a function ?","0"
economic," A function describes a relationship .","1"
economic," Sometimes the relationship is a definition .","0"
economic," 5251 . The concept of slope is very useful in economics , because it measures the relationship between two variables .","1"
economic," A positive slope means that two variables are positively related ; that is , when x increases , so does y , or when x decreases , y decreases also .","1"
economic," Graphically , a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line rises .","0"
economic," 5254 . The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs , because they show a relationship between two variables : one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis .","1"
economic," 5257 . A pie graph ( sometimes called a pie chart ) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts .","1"
economic," A circle represents a group as a whole .","0"
economic," 5260 . This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .","1"
economic," By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility — an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic — the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model . What Is an Indifference Curve ?","0"
economic," 5263 . From this starting point , her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low , while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high — so on the margin , it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book .","0"
economic," In short , the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution — that is , the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant — also changes , as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods .","1"
economic," 5266 . Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations : a substitution effect and an income effect .","0"
economic," The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive , people seek out substitutes .","1"
economic," If oranges become more expensive , fruit - lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples , grapefruit , or raisins .","0"
economic," 5269 . The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen , so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive , but if she had remained at the same level of utility .","0"
economic," The slope of the budget constraint in a labor - leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate .","0"
economic," Thus , the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set , reflecting the labor - leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate , but tangent to the original indifference curve , showing the same level of utility or “ buying power . ”","0"
economic," The shift from original choice A to point C , which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line , shows that because of the higher wage , Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income .","0"
economic," 5272 . The expenditure - output model , sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram , determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced .","1"
economic," The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [ link ] show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending .","0"
economic," 5275 . When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium , it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP — because by definition , GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy .","1"
economic," Thus , the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal — which will only occur along the 45-degree line .","0"
economic," 5278 . The marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures .","1"
economic," The marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save .","1"
economic," It must always hold true that :","0"
economic," 5281 . Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward - sloping line , with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import ( MPI ) , out of national income .","0"
economic," In [ link ] ( b ) , the marginal propensity to import is 0.1 .","0"
economic," 5284 . The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function ( after taxes ) , the investment function , the government spending function , the export function , and the import function .","1"
economic," The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment , government , and export expenditures — which do not vary with national income .","0"
economic," 5287 . Conversely , [ link ] ( b ) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule ( AE0 ) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP .","0"
economic," The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap .","1"
economic," The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting .","0"
economic," 5290 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .","0"
economic," One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .","1"
economic," Conversely , if a situation is inefficient , it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others . Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning : The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved .","1"
economic," 5293 . Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $ 45 , but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $ 80 , clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product .","0"
economic," The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus .","1"
economic," In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium .","0"
economic," The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus .","1"
economic," 5296 . In a very real sense , it is like money thrown away that benefits no one .","0"
economic," In [ link ] ( a ) , the deadweight loss is the area U + W .","0"
economic," When deadweight loss exists , it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher , in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make .","0"
economic," A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers .","0"
economic," After the price ceiling is imposed , the new consumer surplus is T + V , while the new producer surplus is X .","0"
sociology," 5301 . In short , collective behavior is any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution .","1"
sociology," There are three primary forms of collective behavior : the crowd , the mass , and the public .","0"
sociology," It takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form a crowd ( Lofland 1993 ) .","0"
sociology," Examples include a group of people attending an Ani DiFranco concert , tailgating at a Patriots game , or attending a worship service .","0"
sociology," 5304 . Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .","1"
sociology," Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .","1"
sociology," The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot .","1"
sociology," In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .","0"
sociology," 5313 . Sociologist David Aberle ( 1966 ) addresses this question by developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want to change and how much change they want .","0"
sociology," Reform movements seek to change something specific about the social structure .","1"
sociology," Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .","0"
sociology," 5319 . Resource Mobilization and the Civil Rights MovementAn example of resource mobilization theory is activity of the civil rights movement in the decade between the mid 1950s and the mid 1960s .","0"
sociology," Social movements had existed before , notably the Women 's Suffrage Movement and a long line of labor movements , thus constituting an existing social movement sector , which is the multiple social movement industries in a society , even if they have widely varying constituents and goals .","0"
sociology," The civil rights movement had also existed well before Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man .","0"
sociology," 5322 . The anti - gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between a man and a woman .","1"
sociology," Prognostic framing , the second type , offers a solution and states how it will be implemented .","1"
sociology," Some examples of this frame , when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti - gay marriage movement , include the plan to restrict marriage to “ one man / one woman ” or to allow only “ civil unions ” instead of marriages .","0"
sociology," 5325 . New social movement theory , a development of European social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s , attempts to explain the proliferation of postindustrial and postmodern movements that are difficult to analyze using traditional social movement theories .","1"
sociology," Rather than being one specific theory , it is more of a perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics , identity , culture , and social change .","0"
sociology," 5328 . Modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to a developed , technologically driven society ( Irwin 1975 ) .","1"
sociology," By this definition , the level of modernity within a society is judged by the sophistication of its technology , particularly as it relates to infrastructure , industry , and the like .","0"
sociology," 5331 . Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .","1"
sociology," Sociologists working from the micro - level study small groups and individual interactions , while those using macro - level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies .","0"
sociology," For example , a micro - level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals .","0"
sociology," 5334 . Remember , though , that culture is a product of the people in a society ; sociologists take care not to treat the concept of “ culture ” as though it were alive in its own right .","1"
sociology," Reification is an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real , material existence ( Sahn 2013 ) .","1"
sociology," 5340 . In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to "" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . ""","1"
sociology," He and other like - minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes , cultural norms , and societal values .","1"
sociology," This approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict ( traditional in science ) , but to systematically gain an in - depth understanding of social worlds .","0"
sociology," 5343 . Sociologists study social events , interactions , and patterns , and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do .","1"
sociology," In sociology , a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition , called a hypothesis , about society ( Allan 2006 ) .","1"
sociology," 5346 . Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current , but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them ( Calhoun 2002 ) .","0"
sociology," In sociology , a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life , and these are called paradigms .","1"
sociology," Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories , generalizations , and the experiments performed in support of them .","0"
sociology," Three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking , because they provide useful explanations : structural functionalism , conflict theory , and symbolic interactionism .","0"
sociology," 5349 . He believed that to study society , a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashion , and rituals , which all serve to govern social life .","0"
sociology," Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881 – 1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .","0"
sociology," In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .","1"
sociology," 5352 . Another noted structural functionalist , Robert Merton ( 1910 – 2003 ) , pointed out that social processes often have many functions .","0"
sociology," Manifest functions are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated , while latent functions are the unsought consequences of a social process .","1"
sociology," A manifest function of college education , for example , includes gaining knowledge , preparing for a career , and finding a good job that utilizes that education .","0"
sociology," 5355 . conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability .","0"
sociology," Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest .","0"
sociology," Symbolic Interactionist Theory","0"
sociology," Symbolic interactionism is a micro - level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society .","1"
sociology," Communication — the exchange of meaning through language and symbols — is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds .","1"
sociology," 5358 . Sociological research attempts to answer a vast variety of questions , such as these and more , about our social world . We often have opinions about social situations , but these may be biased by our expectations or based on limited data .","0"
sociology," Instead , scientific research is based on empirical evidence , which is evidence that comes from direct experience , scientifically gathered data , or experimentation .","1"
sociology," Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .","0"
sociology," 5361 . A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .","1"
sociology," Sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method , or an interpretative framework , to increase understanding of societies and social interactions , but research begins with the search for an answer to a question .","0"
sociology," 5364 . Sociologists do not rule out any topic , but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms .","0"
sociology," That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms .","0"
sociology," In a hygiene study , for instance , hygiene could be defined as “ personal habits to maintain physical appearance ( as opposed to health ) , ” and a researcher might ask , “ How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance ? ”","1"
sociology," When forming these basic research questions , sociologists develop an operational definition , that is , they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it .","1"
sociology," The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept .","0"
sociology," 5367 . In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .","0"
sociology," In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .","1"
sociology," The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .","1"
sociology," 5370 . A researcher would n’t stroll into a crime - ridden neighborhood at midnight , calling out , “ Any gang members around ? ”","0"
sociology," And if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency , the self - conscious , intimidated baristas might not behave naturally .","0"
sociology," This is called the Hawthorne effect — where people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study .","1"
sociology," The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research .","0"
sociology," 5373 . Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors ( such as sleeping , driving , or texting habits ) or factual information such as employment status , income , and education levels .","0"
sociology," A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .","1"
sociology," Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .","1"
sociology," 5376 . For some topics , the researcher might ask yes - or - no or multiple - choice questions , allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question .","0"
sociology," This kind of quantitative data — research collected in numerical form that can be counted — are easy to tabulate .","1"
sociology," Just count up the number of “ yes ” and “ no ” responses or correct answers , and chart them into percentages .","0"
sociology," Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers — beyond “ yes , ” “ no , ” or the option next to a checkbox .","0"
sociology," 5379 . They meet subjects where they live , work , and play .","0"
sociology," Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey .","1"
sociology," It is a research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method .","0"
sociology," 5382 . Ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting .","1"
sociology," Ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community .","0"
sociology," 5385 . While sociologists often engage in original research studies , they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis .","0"
sociology," Secondary data does n’t result from firsthand research collected from primary sources , but are the already completed work of other researchers .","1"
sociology," 5388 . The ASA is a great resource for students of sociology as well .","0"
sociology," The ASA maintains a code of ethics — formal guidelines for conducting sociological research — consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline .","1"
sociology," It also describes procedures for filing , investigating , and resolving complaints of unethical conduct .","0"
sociology," 5391 . In everyday conversation , people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society , but the terms have slightly different meanings , and the distinction is important to a sociologist .","0"
sociology," A society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture .","1"
sociology," By “ community , ” sociologists refer to a definable region — as small as a neighborhood ( Brooklyn , or “ the east side of town ” ) , as large as a country ( Ethiopia , the United States , or Nepal ) , or somewhere in between ( in the United States , this might include someone who identifies with Southern or Midwestern society ) .","1"
sociology," 5394 . cultural imperialism , the deliberate imposition of one ’s own cultural values on another culture .","1"
sociology," Europe ’s colonial expansion , begun in the sixteenth century , was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism .","0"
sociology," 5397 . Values often suggest how people should behave , but they do n’t accurately reflect how people do behave .","0"
sociology," Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .","1"
sociology," But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .","0"
sociology," 5400 . People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .","0"
sociology," Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .","1"
sociology," Sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions : good grades , for instance , may mean praise from parents and teachers .","0"
sociology," 5403 . There are plenty of formal norms , but the list of informal norms — casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to — is longer .","1"
sociology," People learn informal norms by observation , imitation , and general socialization .","0"
sociology," 5406 . Humans , consciously and subconsciously , are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world .","0"
sociology," Symbols — such as gestures , signs , objects , signals , and words — help people understand that world .","0"
sociology," They provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies .","1"
sociology," 5409 . In each pair , one type of entertainment is considered high - brow and the other low - brow .","0"
sociology," Sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society .","1"
sociology," People often associate high culture with intellectualism , political power , and prestige .","0"
sociology," 5412 . Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures , which are a type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture ’s norms and values .","1"
sociology," In contrast to subcultures , which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society , countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by , sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society .","0"
sociology," 5415 . Inventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts — when things are put together in an entirely new manner .","1"
sociology," In the late 1800s and early 1900s , electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace .","0"
sociology," 5418 . Today , many U.S. companies set up offices in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper .","0"
sociology," When a person in the United States calls to get information about banking , insurance , or computer services , the person taking that call may be working in another country . Alongside the process of globalization is diffusion , or the spread of material and nonmaterial culture .","1"
sociology," While globalization refers to the integration of markets , diffusion relates to a similar process in the integration of international cultures .","1"
sociology," 5421 . Roughly 7,500 years ago , human societies began to recognize their ability to tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants .","0"
sociology," Pastoral societies , such as the Maasai villagers , rely on the domestication of animals as a resource for survival .","1"
sociology," Unlike earlier hunter - gatherers who depended entirely on existing resources to stay alive , pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food , clothing , and transportation , and they created a surplus of goods .","1"
sociology," 5424 . The ninth century gave rise to feudal societies .","0"
sociology," These societies contained a strict hierarchical system of power based around land ownership and protection .","1"
sociology," 5427 . He asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’s actions .","0"
sociology," Durkheim called the communal beliefs , morals , and attitudes of a society the collective conscience .","1"
sociology," In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .","0"
sociology," 5430 . This type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and a low division of labor created shared morals and values among people , such as hunter - gatherer groups .","0"
sociology," When people tend to do the same type of work , Durkheim argued , they tend to think and act alike .","0"
sociology," In industrial societies , mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity , which is social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences .","1"
sociology," In capitalist societies , Durkheim wrote , division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things .","0"
sociology," 5433 . Marx ’s colleague and friend , Frederick Engels , wrote The Condition of the Working - Class in England in 1844 , which described in detail the horrid conditions . Such is the Old Town of Manchester , and on re - reading my description , I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated , it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth , ruin , and uninhabitableness , the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness , ventilation , and health which characterise the construction of this single district , containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants .","0"
sociology," And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England , the first manufacturing city of the world .","0"
sociology," Add to that the long hours , the use of child labor , and exposure to extreme conditions of heat , cold , and toxic chemicals , and it is no wonder that Marx and Engels referred to capitalism , which is a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products ( such as land , oil , factories , ships , etc . )","1"
sociology," are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government , as the “ dictatorship of the bourgeoisie .","0"
sociology," ” Karl Marx ( left ) and Friedrich Engels ( right ) analyzed differences in social power between “ have ” and “ have - not ” groups .","0"
sociology," 5436 . In order for society to overcome false consciousness , Marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness , the awareness of one ’s rank in society .","1"
sociology," Instead of existing as a “ class in itself , ” the proletariat must become a “ class for itself ” in order to produce social change ( Marx and Engels 1848 ) , meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society , the class could become an advocate for social improvements .","1"
sociology," 5439 . In 1966 sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote a book called The Social Construction of Reality .","0"
sociology," In it , they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction , which they call habitualization .","0"
sociology," Habitualization describes how “ any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into a pattern , which can then be … performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort ” ( Berger and Luckmann 1966 ) .","1"
sociology," 5442 . That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .","0"
sociology," For example , a teenager who is repeatedly given a label — overachiever , player , bum — might live up to the term even though it initially was n’t a part of his character . Like Berger and Luckmann in their description of habitualization , Thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by “ successive definitions of the situation .","0"
sociology," ” This concept is defined by sociologist Robert K. Merton as a self - fulfilling prophecy .","0"
sociology," Merton explains that with a self - fulfilling prophecy , even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon .","0"
sociology," 5445 . Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .","1"
sociology," Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .","1"
sociology," Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .","1"
sociology," 5448 . Even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or array of roles , attached to it ( Merton 1957 ) .","0"
sociology," If too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role strain .","1"
sociology," Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .","0"
sociology," 5451 . Goffman ’s dramaturgy ideas expand on the ideas of Charles Cooley and the looking - glass self .","0"
sociology," According to Cooley , we base our image on what we think other people see ( Cooley 1902 ) .","0"
sociology," 5454 . A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , while asylum - seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated .","1"
sociology," An internally displaced person , on the other hand , is neither a refugee nor an asylum - seeker .","1"
sociology," Displaced persons have fled their homes while remaining inside their country ’s borders .","1"
sociology," 5457 . Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions .","0"
sociology," As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .","0"
sociology," Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .","1"
sociology," New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .","1"
sociology," 5460 . As cities evolve from manufacturing - based industrial to service- and information - based postindustrial societies , gentrification becomes more common .","0"
sociology," Gentrification occurs when members of the middle and upper classes enter and renovate city areas that have been historically less affluent while the poor urban underclass are forced by resulting price pressures to leave those neighborhoods for increasingly decaying portions of the city .","1"
sociology," Globally , 54 percent of the world ’s 7 billion people currently reside in urban areas , with the most urbanized region being North America ( 82 percent ) , followed by Latin America / the Caribbean ( 80 percent ) , with Europe coming in third ( 72 percent ) .","0"
sociology," 5463 . The challenge for a human ecologist working in U.S. urban planning is to design landscapes and waterscapes with natural beauty , while also figuring out how to provide for free - flowing transport of innumerable vehicles , not to mention parking !","0"
sociology," The concentric zone model ( Burgess 1925 ) is perhaps the most famous example of human ecology .","0"
sociology," This model views a city as a series of concentric circular areas , expanding outward from the center of the city , with various “ zones ” invading adjacent zones ( as new categories of people and businesses overrun the edges of nearby zones ) and succeeding ( then after invasion , the new inhabitants repurpose the areas they have invaded and push out the previous inhabitants ) .","1"
sociology," 5466 . The GCCI is a United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of peripheral and semi - peripheral countries by encouraging the use of alternative , low - carbon , energy sources with financial incentives .","0"
sociology," Programming is organized around three pillars : ( 1 ) climate change adaptation , ( 2 ) clean energy , and ( 3 ) sustainable landscapes ( Troilo 2012 ) .","1"
sociology," Pollution","0"
sociology," Pollution describes what happens when contaminants are introduced into an environment ( water , air , land ) at levels that are damaging .","1"
sociology," Environments can often sustain a limited amount of contaminants without marked change , and water , air , and soil can “ heal ” themselves to a certain degree .","0"
sociology," 5469 . Environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group neighborhoods ( populated primarily by people of color and members of low socioeconomic groups ) are burdened with a disproportionate number of hazards , including toxic waste facilities , garbage dumps , and other sources of environmental pollution and foul odors that lower the quality of life .","1"
sociology," All around the globe , members of minority groups bear a greater burden of the health problems that result from higher exposure to waste and pollution .","0"
sociology," 5472 . To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .","1"
sociology," Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .","1"
sociology," The fertility number is generally lower than the fecundity number , which measures the potential number of children that could be born to women of childbearing age .","1"
sociology," 5475 . This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .","0"
sociology," The population composition includes the sex ratio , the number of men for every hundred women , as well as the population pyramid , a picture of population distribution by sex and age ( [ link ] ) .","1"
sociology," This population pyramid shows the breakdown of the 2010 U.S. population according to age and sex .","0"
sociology," ( Graph courtesy of Econ Proph blog and the U.S. Census Bureau )","0"
sociology," 5478 . Of course , some theories are less focused on the pessimistic hypothesis that the world ’s population will meet a detrimental challenge to sustaining itself .","0"
sociology," Cornucopian theory scoffs at the idea of humans wiping themselves out ; it asserts that human ingenuity can resolve any environmental or social issues that develop .","1"
sociology," As an example , it points to the issue of food supply .","0"
sociology," 5481 . They learn to understand interactions involving different people with a variety of purposes .","0"
sociology," For example , a child at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in a restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience ( someone seats you , another takes your order , someone else cooks the food , while yet another clears away dirty dishes ) .","0"
sociology," Finally , children develop , understand , and learn the idea of the generalized other , the common behavioral expectations of general society .","0"
sociology," By this stage of development , an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others — and thus , from a sociological perspective , to have a “ self ” ( Mead 1934 ; Mead 1964 ) .","1"
sociology," Kohlberg ’s Theory of Moral Development","0"
sociology," 5484 . According to this belief , our temperaments , interests , and talents are set before birth .","0"
sociology," From this perspective , then , who we are depends on nature .","0"
sociology," 5487 . In the process of resocialization , old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role are removed because they are no longer of use .","1"
sociology," Resocialization is necessary when a person moves to a senior care center , goes to boarding school , or serves time in jail .","0"
sociology," 5490 . School and classroom rituals , led by teachers serving as role models and leaders , regularly reinforce what society expects from children .","1"
sociology," Sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden curriculum , the informal teaching done by schools .","1"
sociology," 5493 . A rally is usually a one - time event , for instance , and belonging to a political party does n’t imply interaction with others .","0"
sociology," People who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks — are considered an aggregate , or a crowd .","1"
sociology," Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .","0"
sociology," 5496 . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face - to - face in long - term emotional ways .","1"
sociology," This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones .","0"
sociology," The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization .","0"
sociology," 5499 . A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to — it provides a standard of measurement .","1"
sociology," In U.S. society , peer groups are common reference groups .","0"
sociology," 5502 . Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly .","0"
sociology," Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .","1"
sociology," An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .","1"
sociology," We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader .","0"
sociology," 5505 . Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .","0"
sociology," Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .","1"
sociology," They work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward .","0"
sociology," 5508 . She would n’t want people to think she was too poor to find proper clothes .","0"
sociology," Conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or expectations .","1"
sociology," As you might recall , we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act , to dress , and to behave .","0"
sociology," 5511 . Sociologist Amitai Etzioni ( 1975 ) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories .","0"
sociology," Normative organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests .","1"
sociology," As the name suggests , joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way .","0"
sociology," 5514 . A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .","1"
sociology," The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward .","1"
sociology," High school and the workplace fall into this category — one joined in pursuit of a diploma , the other in order to make money .","0"
sociology," 5517 . The existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are outlined , written down , and standardized .","1"
sociology," For example , at your college or university , the student guidelines are contained within the Student Handbook .","0"
sociology," 5520 . While ostensibly based on meritocracy , bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only recognizing the merit in traditionally male and privileged paths .","0"
sociology," Michels ( 1911 ) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the Iron Rule of Oligarchy , wherein an entire organization is ruled by a few elites .","1"
sociology," Do you think this is true ?","0"
sociology," 5523 . An adult belching loudly is avoided .","0"
sociology," All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .","1"
sociology," The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .","1"
sociology," 5526 . Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .","0"
sociology," Positive sanctions are rewards given for conforming to norms .","1"
sociology," A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .","0"
sociology," 5529 . Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .","0"
sociology," For example , wearing flip - flops to an opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands , whereas behavior that is seen as positive — such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street — may receive positive informal reactions , such as a smile or pat on the back .","0"
sociology," Formal sanctions , on the other hand , are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations .","1"
sociology," If a student violates her college ’s code of conduct , for example , she might be expelled .","0"
sociology," 5532 . Cultural deviance theory suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower - class society causes crime .","1"
sociology," Researchers Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay ( 1942 ) studied crime patterns in Chicago in the early 1900s .","0"
sociology," 5535 . In his book The Power Elite ( 1956 ) , sociologist C. Wright Mills described the existence of what he dubbed the power elite , a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold the power and resources .","1"
sociology," Wealthy executives , politicians , celebrities , and military leaders often have access to national and international power , and in some cases , their decisions affect everyone in society .","0"
sociology," 5538 . Individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future . Sometimes , in more extreme cases , primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance .","0"
sociology," Secondary deviance occurs when a person ’s self - concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as deviant by members of society .","1"
sociology," The person may begin to take on and fulfill the role of a “ deviant ” as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such .","0"
sociology," 5541 . Although deviance is a violation of social norms , it ’s not always punishable , and it ’s not necessarily bad .","1"
sociology," Crime , on the other hand , is a behavior that violates official law and is punishable through formal sanctions .","1"
sociology," Walking to class backward is a deviant behavior .","0"
sociology," 5544 . Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .","0"
sociology," Nonviolent crimes involve the destruction or theft of property but do not use force or the threat of force .","1"
sociology," Because of this , they are also sometimes called “ property crimes . ” Larceny , car theft , and vandalism are all types of nonviolent crimes .","0"
sociology," 5547 . Although these types of offenses rarely receive the same amount of media coverage as street crimes , they can be far more damaging .","0"
sociology," Financial frauds such as insurance scams , Ponzi schemes , and improper practices by banks can devastate families who lose their savings or home . An often - debated third type of crime is victimless crime .","0"
sociology," Crimes are called victimless when the perpetrator is not explicitly harming another person .","1"
sociology," 5550 . The U.S. Criminal Justice SystemA criminal justice system is an organization that exists to enforce a legal code .","1"
sociology," There are three branches of the U.S. criminal justice system : the police , the courts , and the corrections system .","0"
sociology," 5553 . The corrections system , more commonly known as the prison system , is charged with supervising individuals who have been arrested , convicted , and sentenced for a criminal offense .","1"
sociology," At the end of 2010 , approximately seven million U.S. men and women were behind bars ( BJS 2011d ) .","0"
sociology," 5556 . Those students with more exposure gain more proficiency , which makes them far more marketable in an increasingly technology - based job market and leaves our society divided into those with technological knowledge and those without .","0"
sociology," Even as we improve access , we have failed to address an increasingly evident gap in e - readiness — the ability to sort through , interpret , and process knowledge ( Sciadas 2003 ) .","1"
sociology," Since the beginning of the millennium , social science researchers have tried to bring attention to the digital divide , the uneven access to technology among different races , classes , and geographic areas .","0"
sociology," The term became part of the common lexicon in 1996 , when then Vice President Al Gore used it in a speech .","0"
sociology," 5559 . However , this exemption is temporary and relative to the severity of the illness .","0"
sociology," The exemption also requires legitimation by a physician ; that is , a physician must certify that the illness is genuine .","0"
sociology," 5562 . The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .","1"
sociology," A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .","1"
sociology," Medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient , how people respond to the patient , and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient ( Conrad and Schneider 1992 ) .","0"
sociology," 5565 . It expands eligibility to programs like Medicaid and CHIP , helps guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre - existing conditions , and establishes regulations to make sure that the premium funds collected by insurers and care providers go directly to medical care .","0"
sociology," It also includes an individual mandate , which requires everyone to have insurance coverage by 2014 or pay a penalty .","0"
sociology," A series of provisions , including significant subsidies , are intended to address the discrepancies in income that are currently contributing to high rates of uninsurance and underinsurance .","0"
sociology," 5568 . Again , the lowest - income countries , especially in the African region , experience the worst problems with disease .","0"
sociology," An important component of disease prevention and control is epidemiology , or the study of the incidence , distribution , and possible control of diseases .","1"
sociology," Fear of Ebola contamination , primarily in Western Africa but also to a smaller degree in the United States , became national news in the summer and fall of 2014 .","0"
sociology," Summary","0"
sociology," 5571 . She further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis , saying that it predisposes many people , both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy , against women who have been so diagnosed ( Becker ) .","0"
sociology," Many critics also point to the medicalization of women ’s issues as an example of institutionalized sexism .","0"
sociology," Medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy .","1"
sociology," Historically and contemporaneously , many aspects of women ’s lives have been medicalized , including menstruation , pre - menstrual syndrome , pregnancy , childbirth , and menopause .","0"
sociology," 5574 . And bipolar disorder is characterized by dramatic shifts in energy and mood , often affecting the individual ’s ability to carry out day - to - day tasks .","1"
sociology," Bipolar disorder used to be called manic depression because of the way people would swing between manic and depressive episodes . Depending on what definition is used , there is some overlap between mood disorders and personality disorders , which affect 9 percent of people in the United States yearly .","0"
sociology," The American Psychological Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders ( DSM ) , and their definition of personality disorders is changing in the fifth edition , which is being revised in 2011 and 2012 .","0"
sociology," 5577 . Ramps on sidewalks , Braille instructions , and more accessible door levers are all accommodations to help people with disabilities . People with disabilities can be stigmatized by their illnesses .","0"
sociology," Stigmatization means their identity is spoiled ; they are labeled as different , discriminated against , and sometimes even shunned .","1"
sociology," They are labeled ( as an interactionist might point out ) and ascribed a master status ( as a functionalist might note ) , becoming “ the blind girl ” or “ the boy in the wheelchair ” instead of someone afforded a full identity by society .","0"
sociology," 5580 . If sociology is the systematic study of human behavior in society , medical sociology is the systematic study of how humans manage issues of health and illness , disease and disorders , and healthcare for both the sick and the healthy .","1"
sociology," Medical sociologists study the physical , mental , and social components of health and illness .","1"
sociology," 5583 . Technology and the media are interwoven , and neither can be separated from contemporary society in most core and semi - peripheral nations .","0"
sociology," Media is a term that refers to all print , digital , and electronic means of communication .","1"
sociology," From the time the printing press was created ( and even before ) , technology has influenced how and where information is shared .","0"
sociology," 5586 . Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design , this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product .","0"
sociology," Plant patents , the final type , recognize the discovery of new plant types that can be asexually reproduced .","1"

sociology," 5589 . And appliance repair people say that while they might be fixing some machines that are twenty years old , they generally are n’t fixing those that are seven years old ; newer models are built to be thrown out .","0"
sociology," This strategy is called planned obsolescence , and it is the business practice of planning for a product to be obsolete or unusable from the time it is created .","1"
sociology," To some extent , planned obsolescence is a natural extension of new and emerging technologies .","0"
sociology," 5592 . Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets .","1"
sociology," This creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace .","0"
sociology," In 1983 , a mere 50 corporations owned the bulk of mass - media outlets .","0"
sociology," 5595 . Powerful individuals and social institutions have a great deal of influence over which forms of technology are released , when and where they are released , and what kind of media is available for our consumption , which is a form of gatekeeping .","0"
sociology," Shoemaker and Vos ( 2009 ) define gatekeeping as the sorting process by which thousands of possible messages are shaped into a mass media - appropriate form and reduced to a manageable amount .","1"
sociology," In other words , the people in charge of the media decide what the public is exposed to , which , as C. Wright Mills ( 1956 ) famously noted , is the heart of media ’s power .","0"
sociology," 5598 . The kind of computer you own , the kind of car you drive , your ability to afford the latest Apple product — these serve as a social indicator of wealth and status .","0"
sociology," Neo - Luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life .","1"
sociology," But for technophiles , technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future .","1"
sociology," 5601 . The number of supervisory and managerial positions has been reduced as companies streamline their command structures and industries continue to consolidate through mergers .","0"
sociology," Even highly educated skilled workers such as computer programmers have seen their jobs vanish overseas . The automation of the workplace , which replaces workers with technology , is another cause of the changes in the job market .","0"
sociology," Computers can be programmed to do many routine tasks faster and less expensively than people who used to do such tasks .","0"
sociology," 5604 . A certain amount of unemployment is a direct result of the relative inflexibility of the labor market , considered structural unemployment , which describes when there is a societal level of disjuncture between people seeking jobs and the available jobs .","1"
sociology," This mismatch can be geographic ( they are hiring in California , but most unemployed live in Alabama ) , technological ( skilled workers are replaced by machines , as in the auto industry ) , or can result from any sudden change in the types of jobs people are seeking versus the types of companies that are hiring .","0"
sociology," 5610 . In 1893 , Émile Durkheim described what he called “ mechanical ” and “ organic ” solidarity that correlates to a society ’s economy .","0"
sociology," Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .","1"
sociology," Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .","1"
sociology," 5613 . To solve this problem , people developed the idea of a means of exchange that could be used at any time : that is , money .","0"
sociology," Money refers to an object that a society agrees to assign a value to so it can be exchanged for payment .","1"
sociology," In early economies , money was often objects like cowry shells , rice , barley , or even rum .","0"
sociology," 5616 . Scholars do n’t always agree on a single definition of capitalism .","0"
sociology," For our purposes , we will define capitalism as an economic system in which there is private ownership ( as opposed to state ownership ) and where there is an impetus to produce profit , and thereby wealth .","1"
sociology," This is the type of economy in place in the United States today .","0"
sociology," 5619 . By this he meant that if an owner did not work to produce or earn the property , then the owner was stealing it from those who did .","0"
sociology," Proudhon believed economies could work using a principle called mutualism , under which individuals and cooperative groups would exchange products with one another on the basis of mutually satisfactory contracts ( Proudhon 1840 ) .","1"
sociology," By far the most important influential thinker on socialism is Karl Marx .","0"
sociology," Through his own writings and those with his collaborator , industrialist Friedrich Engels , Marx used a scientific analytical process to show that throughout history , the resolution of class struggles caused changes in economies .","0"
sociology," 5622 . The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .","0"
sociology," In reality , to control the risk of an economic depression ( a sustained recession across several economic sectors ) , the U.S. government will often adjust interest rates to encourage more lending — and consequently more spending .","1"
sociology," In short , letting the natural cycle fluctuate is not a gamble most governments are willing to take .","0"
sociology," 5625 . Factors that define stratification vary in different societies .","0"
sociology," In most societies , stratification is an economic system , based on wealth , the net value of money and assets a person has , and income , a person ’s wages or investment dividends .","1"
sociology," While people are regularly categorized based on how rich or poor they are , other important factors influence social standing .","0"
sociology," 5628 . A class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement .","1"
sociology," A class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth , income , education , and occupation .","1"
sociology," Unlike caste systems , class systems are open .","0"
sociology," 5631 . Meritocracy","0"
sociology," Meritocracy is an ideal system based on the belief that social stratification is the result of personal effort — or merit — that determines social standing .","1"
sociology," High levels of effort will lead to a high social position , and vice versa .","0"
sociology," 5634 . In the last century , the United States has seen a steady rise in its standard of living , the level of wealth available to a certain socioeconomic class in order to acquire the material necessities and comforts to maintain its lifestyle .","1"
sociology," The standard of living is based on factors such as income , employment , class , poverty rates , and housing affordability .","0"
sociology," 5637 . In the United States , people who earn a college degree , get a job promotion , or marry someone with a good income may move up socially .","0"
sociology," In contrast , downward mobility indicates a lowering of one ’s social class .","1"
sociology," Some people move downward because of business setbacks , unemployment , or illness .","0"
sociology," 5640 . Patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long - term societal changes .","0"
sociology," Similarly , intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person 's social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime .","1"
sociology," For example , the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings .","0"
sociology," Structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder .","1"
sociology," Structural mobility is attributable to changes in society as a whole , not individual changes .","0"
sociology," 5643 . In 1945 , sociologists Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore published the Davis - Moore thesis , which argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role , the greater must be the reward .","0"
sociology," The theory posits that social stratification represents the inherently unequal value of different work .","1"
sociology," 5646 . In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .","0"
sociology," The GINI coefficient measures income inequality between countries using a 100- point scale on which 1 represents complete equality and 100 represents the highest possible inequality .","1"
sociology," In 2007 , the global GINI coefficient that measured the wealth gap between the core nations in the northern part of the world and the mostly peripheral nations in the southern part of the world was 75.5 percent ( Korseniewicz and Moran 2009 ) .","0"

sociology," Researchers also strive for validity , which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure .","1"
sociology," Returning to the crime rate during a full moon topic , reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full moon .","0"
sociology," 5366 . A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related ; it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables .","1"
sociology," In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .","0"
sociology," 5369 . While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach , others operate from an interpretive framework .","0"
sociology," While systematic , this approach does n’t follow the hypothesis - testing model that seeks to find generalizable results .","0"

sociology," However , Rothman ’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “ dot com ” company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material .","0"
sociology," Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation , in which researchers join people and participate in a group ’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context .","1"
sociology," This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life .","0"
sociology," 5384 . One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment , meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis — a scientific approach .","1"
sociology," 5387 . A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records .","0"
sociology," To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources , sociologists employ content analysis , applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand .","1"

sociology," Rather , folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day - to - day practices and expressions of a culture .","0"
sociology," 5408 . In the United States , for example , the number thirteen is associated with bad luck .","0"
sociology," In Japan , however , the number four is considered unlucky , since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “ death . ”","0"
sociology," The Sapir - Whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language , and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their language .","0"
sociology," The hypothesis , which has also been called linguistic relativity , states that language shapes thought ( Swoyer 2003 ) .","1"
sociology," 5411 . Subculture and Counterculture","0"
sociology," A subculture is just what it sounds like — a smaller cultural group within a larger culture ; people of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group .","1"
sociology," 5420 . Hunter - gatherer societies demonstrate the strongest dependence on the environment of the various types of preindustrial societies .","0"
sociology," As the basic structure of human society until about 10,000–12,000 years ago , these groups were based around kinship or tribes .","0"
sociology," 5429 . His primary concern was that the cultural glue that held society together was failing , and people were becoming more divided .","0"
sociology," In his book The Division of Labor in Society ( 1893 ) , Durkheim argued that as society grew more complex , social order made the transition from mechanical to organic . Preindustrial societies , Durkheim explained , were held together by mechanical solidarity , a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture .","0"
sociology," Societies with mechanical solidarity act in a mechanical fashion ; things are done mostly because they have always been done that way .","0"
sociology," 5432 . Additionally , Marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change .","0"
sociology," Economically , he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production — the bourgeoisie — and the laborers , called the proletariat .","1"
sociology," Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution .","0"
sociology," 5435 . Another idea that Marx developed is the concept of false consciousness .","0"
sociology," False consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs , ideals , or ideology of a person are not in the person ’s own best interest .","1"
sociology," 5438 . The symbolic interactionism theory , the third of the three most recognized theories of sociology , is based on Weber ’s early ideas that emphasize the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society .","0"
sociology," For Weber , the culmination of industrialization , rationalization , and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage , in which the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy .","1"
sociology," This leads to a sense of “ disenchantment of the world , ” a phrase Weber used to describe the final condition of humanity .","1"
sociology," 5441 . Another way of looking at this concept is through W.I .","0"
sociology," Thomas ’s notable Thomas theorem which states , “ If men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences ” ( Thomas and Thomas 1928 ) .","0"
sociology," That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .","0"
sociology," 5444 . Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .","1"
sociology," Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .","1"
sociology," 5450 . All we can observe is behavior , or role performance .","0"
sociology," Role performance is how a person expresses his or her role .","1"
sociology," Sociologist Erving Goffman presented the idea that a person is like an actor on a stage .","0"
sociology," 5456 . And commuting times and distances have continued to increase as new suburbs developed farther and farther from city centers .","0"
sociology," Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions .","0"
sociology," As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .","1"
sociology," Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .","1"
sociology," 5459 . As the Social Policy & Debate feature illustrates , the suburbs also have their share of socio - economic problems .","0"
sociology," In the United States , white flight refers to the migration of economically secure white people from racially mixed urban areas and toward the suburbs .","1"
sociology," This occurred throughout the twentieth century , due to causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by Brown v. Board of Education to the Mariel boatlift of Cubans fleeing Cuba ’s Mariel port for Miami .","0"
sociology," 5465 . While you might be more familiar with the phrase “ global warming , ” climate change is the term now used to refer to long - term shifts in temperatures due to human activity and , in particular , the release of greenhouse gases into the environment .","1"
sociology," The planet as a whole is warming , but the term climate change acknowledges that the short - term variations in this process can include both higher and lower temperatures , despite the overarching trend toward warmth .","0"
sociology," 5468 . Often , the stories are not newsmakers , but simply an unpleasant part of life for the people who live near toxic sites such as Centralia , Pennsylvania and Hinkley , California .","0"
sociology," In many cases , people in these neighborhoods can be part of a cancer cluster without realizing the cause .","0"
sociology," 5471 . Where will people live ?","0"
sociology," To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .","1"
sociology," Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .","1"
sociology," 5474 . Changing fertility , mortality , and migration rates make up the total population composition , a snapshot of the demographic profile of a population .","1"
sociology," This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .","0"
sociology," 5477 . Ehrlich 's ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse , as privileged people use up or pollute a number of environmental resources such as water and air .","0"
sociology," He advocated for a goal of zero population growth ( ZPG ) , in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration .","1"
sociology," While support for this concept is mixed , it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation .","0"
sociology," 5480 . Later , George Herbert Mead ( 1863 – 1931 ) studied the self , a person ’s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction .","1"
sociology," In order to engage in this process of “ self , ” an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the eyes of others .","0"
sociology," 5483 . Most importantly , we have to learn language — whether it ’s the dominant language or one common in a subculture , whether it ’s verbal or through signs — in order to communicate and to think .","0"
sociology," As we saw with Danielle , without socialization we literally have no self . Nature versus NurtureSome experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture — the relationships and caring that surround us .","1"
sociology," Others argue that who we are is based entirely in genetics .","0"
sociology," 5486 . Just as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers , play house , and dress up , adults also engage in anticipatory socialization , the preparation for future life roles .","1"
sociology," Examples would include a couple who cohabitate before marriage or soon - to - be parents who read infant care books and prepare their home for the new arrival .","0"
sociology," 5489 . Peer GroupsA peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests .","1"
sociology," Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years , such as when kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns , the rules of a game , or how to shoot a basket .","0"
sociology," 5492 . The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings , from just two people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you partner with another student ) , a club , a regular gathering of friends , or people who work together or share a hobby .","1"
sociology," In short , the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group .","0"
sociology," 5495 . Types of Groups","0"
sociology," Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864 – 1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) .","0"
sociology," According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives .","0"
sociology," 5498 . The feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way .","0"
sociology," Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 – 1910 ) developed the concepts of in - group and out - group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) .","0"
sociology," In short , an in - group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is .","1"
sociology," 5501 . After all , how well could soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out orders ?","0"
sociology," Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .","1"
sociology," An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .","1"
sociology," 5504 . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's experiences provide an example of the way society reacts to a high - profile woman who is an instrumental leader .","0"
sociology," Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership .","0"
sociology," In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .","0"
sociology," Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .","1"
sociology," 5507 . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress .","0"
sociology," As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks .","1"
sociology," These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals .","0"
sociology," 5510 . From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized .","0"
sociology," Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies .","0"
sociology," A bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization .","1"
sociology," 5513 . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .","0"
sociology," Symbolic interactionist Erving Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) .","0"
sociology," A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .","1"
sociology," 5516 . A clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy , each individual has a specialized task to perform .","1"
sociology," For example , psychology professors teach psychology , but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms .","0"
sociology," 5519 . This results in an impersonal organization .","0"
sociology," Customers frequently complain that stores like Walmart care little about individuals , other businesses , and the community at large .","0"
sociology," Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice .","1"
sociology," In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript .","0"
sociology," 5522 . And what is the relationship between deviance and crime ?","0"
sociology," According to sociologist William Graham Sumner , deviance is a violation of established contextual , cultural , or social norms , whether folkways , mores , or codified law ( 1906 ) .","1"
sociology," It can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder .","0"
sociology," 5525 . Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .","0"
sociology," When a worker violates a workplace guideline , the manager steps in to enforce the rules ; when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules , the manager may praise or promote the employee .","0"
sociology," The means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions .","1"
sociology," Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .","0"
sociology," 5528 . Although shoplifting , a form of social deviance , may be illegal , there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose .","0"
sociology," That does n’t mean picking your nose in public wo n’t be punished ; instead , you will encounter informal sanctions .","0"
sociology," Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .","0"
sociology," 5531 . Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s , social disorganization theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control .","1"
sociology," An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use , violence , teenage delinquency , and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community .","0"
sociology," 5534 . Conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of German philosopher , economist , and social scientist Karl Marx .","0"
sociology," Marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups .","0"
sociology," 5537 . Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation .","0"
sociology," Primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others .","1"
sociology," Speeding is a deviant act , but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept .","0"
sociology," 5540 . Since criminology was a young field , he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( Laub 2006 ) .","0"
sociology," His conclusions established differential association theory , which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance .","1"
sociology," According to Sutherland , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes .","0"
sociology," 5543 . In modern U.S. society , crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity .","0"
sociology," Violent crimes ( also known as “ crimes against a person ” ) are based on the use of force or the threat of force .","1"
sociology," Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .","0"
sociology," 5546 . When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .","1"
sociology," An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .","1"
sociology," Embezzlement , insider trading , and identity theft are all types of corporate crime .","0"
sociology," 5549 . Due to these issues , the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics publishes a separate self - report study known as the National Crime Victimization Report ( NCVR ) .","0"
sociology," A self - report study is a collection of data gathered using voluntary response methods , such as questionnaires or telephone interviews .","1"
sociology," Self - report data are gathered each year , asking approximately 160,000 people in the United States about the frequency and types of crime they ’ve experienced in their daily lives ( BJS 2013 ) .","0"
sociology," 5552 . CourtsOnce a crime has been committed and a violator has been identified by the police , the case goes to court .","0"
sociology," A court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law .","1"
sociology," The U.S. judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts .","0"
sociology," 5555 . The first is differential class - based access to technology in the form of the digital divide .","0"
sociology," This digital divide has led to the second form , a knowledge gap , which is , as it sounds , an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology .","1"
sociology," Simply put , students in well - funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in poorly funded schools .","0"
sociology," 5558 . According to the functionalist perspective , health is vital to the stability of the society , and therefore sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance .","0"
sociology," Talcott Parsons ( 1951 ) was the first to discuss this in terms of the sick role : patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who take care of them .","0"
sociology," 5561 . As we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness .","1"
sociology," The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .","1"
sociology," A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .","1"
sociology," 5564 . Unfortunately , the U.S. Census Current Population Survey of 2013 shows that 18 percent of people in the United States have no health insurance at all .","0"
sociology," Equally alarming , a study by the Commonwealth Fund shows that in 2010 , 81 million adults were either uninsured or underinsured ; that is , people who pay at least 10 percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or , for low - income adults , those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least 5 percent of their income ( Schoen , Doty , Robertson , and Collins 2011 ) .","0"
sociology," The Commonwealth study further reports that while underinsurance has historically been an issue that low - income families faced , today it is affecting middle - income families more and more . Why are so many people uninsured or underinsured ?","0"
sociology," 5567 . The best example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain , where the National Health System ( NHS ) gives free healthcare to all its residents .","0"
sociology," And despite some U.S. citizens ’ knee - jerk reaction to any healthcare changes that hint of socialism , the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health Administration .","0"
sociology," It is important to distinguish between socialized medicine , in which the government owns the healthcare system , and universal healthcare , which is simply a system that guarantees healthcare coverage for everyone .","1"
sociology," Germany , Singapore , and Canada all have universal healthcare .","0"
sociology," 5570 . Marilyn Winkleby and her research associates ( 1992 ) state that “ one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of a person 's morbidity and mortality experience is that person 's socioeconomic status ( SES ) .","0"
sociology," This finding persists across all diseases with few exceptions , continues throughout the entire lifespan , and extends across numerous risk factors for disease . ”","0"
sociology," Morbidity is the incidence of disease .","1"
sociology," It is important to remember that economics are only part of the SES picture ; research suggests that education also plays an important role .","0"
sociology," Phelan and Link ( 2003 ) note that many behavior - influenced diseases like lung cancer ( from smoking ) , coronary artery disease ( from poor eating and exercise habits ) , and AIDS initially were widespread across SES groups .","0"
sociology," 5573 . Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time .","1"
sociology," Anxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , panic disorders , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and both social and specific phobias .","0"
sociology," The second most common mental disorders in the United States are mood disorders ; roughly 10 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected yearly , while 21 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .","0"
sociology," Major mood disorders are depression , bipolar disorder , and dysthymic disorder .","0"
sociology," 5576 . The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .","0"
sociology," They use the term impairment to describe the physical limitations , while reserving the term disability to refer to the social limitation .","1"
sociology," Before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) in 1990 , people in the United States with disabilities were often excluded from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted .","0"
sociology," 5579 . Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases .","1"
sociology," Social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations .","0"
sociology," 5582 . The stigma may keep people from seeking help for their illness , making it worse than it needs to be .","0"
sociology," Contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals .","1"
sociology," Disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the patients ’ heads , depending on the opinion of the medical professional .","0"
sociology," 5585 . These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .","0"
sociology," The second type of patent is a design patent .","0"
sociology," Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design , this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product .","1"
sociology," 5588 . New media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange .","1"
sociology," These include social networking sites , blogs , podcasts , wikis , and virtual worlds .","0"
sociology," 5591 . But the numbers are misleading .","0"
sociology," Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets .","1"
sociology," This creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace .","1"
sociology," 5594 . Such a fast - paced dynamic is not always to our benefit .","0"
sociology," Some sociologists assert that this level of media exposure leads to narcotizing dysfunction , a result in which people are too overwhelmed with media input to really care about the issue , so their involvement becomes defined by awareness instead of by action ( Lazerfeld and Merton 1948 ) .","1"
sociology," 5597 . Increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism is cyberfeminism , the application to , and promotion of , feminism online .","1"
sociology," Research on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the liberating use of blogs by women living in Iraq during the second Gulf War ( Peirce 2011 ) to an investigation of the Suicide Girls web site ( Magnet 2007 ) .","0"
sociology," 5600 . Geography , race , gender , and other factors have always played a role in the reality of success .","0"
sociology," More recently , the increased outsourcing — or contracting a job or set of jobs to an outside source — of manufacturing jobs to developing nations has greatly diminished the number of high - paying , often unionized , blue - collar positions available .","1"
sociology," A similar problem has arisen in the white - collar sector , with many low - level clerical and support positions also being outsourced , as evidenced by the international technical - support call centers in Mumbai , India , and Newfoundland , Canada .","0"
sociology," 5603 . This must be contrasted with the absolute poverty that is frequently found in underdeveloped countries and defined as the inability , or near - inability , to afford basic necessities such as food ( Byrns 2011).We can not even rely on unemployment statistics to provide a clear picture of total unemployment in the United States .","1"
sociology," First , unemployment statistics do not take into account underemployment , a state in which a person accepts a lower paying , lower status job than their education and experience qualifies them to perform .","1"
sociology," Second , unemployment statistics only count those :","0"
sociology," 5606 . We see the emergence of global assembly lines , where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions .","1"
sociology," For instance , Apple designs its next - generation Mac prototype in the United States , components are made in various peripheral nations , they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly , and tech support is outsourced to India . Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains , where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing ( Plahe 2005 ) .","1"
sociology," 5609 . What if the U.S. economy thrived solely on basic bartering instead of its bustling agricultural and technological goods ?","0"
sociology," Would you still see a busy building like the one shown in [ link]?In sociology , economy refers to the social institution through which a society ’s resources are exchanged and managed .","1"
sociology," The earliest economies were based on trade , which is often a simple exchange in which people traded one item for another .","1"
sociology," 5612 . At first , most goods and services were traded as gifts or through bartering between small social groups ( Mauss 1922 ) .","0"
sociology," Exchanging one form of goods or services for another was known as bartering .","1"
sociology," This system only works when one person happens to have something the other person needs at the same time .","0"
sociology," 5615 . The Industrial Revolution also changed agricultural practices .","0"
sociology," Until that time , many people practiced subsistence farming in which they produced only enough to feed themselves and pay their taxes .","1"
sociology," New technology introduced gasoline - powered farm tools such as tractors , seed drills , threshers , and combine harvesters .","0"
sociology," 5618 . Because of challenges in their economies , several of these communist countries have moved from central planning to letting market forces help determine many production and pricing decisions .","0"
sociology," Market socialism describes a subtype of socialism that adopts certain traits of capitalism , like allowing limited private ownership or consulting market demands .","1"
sociology," This could involve situations like profits generated by a company going directly to the employees of the company or being used as public funds ( Gregory and Stuart 2003 ) .","0"
sociology," 5621 . Markets produce goods as they are supposed to , but eventually the market is saturated and the supply of goods exceeds the demands .","0"
sociology," Typically the market goes through phases of surplus , or excess , inflation , where the money in your pocket today buys less than it did yesterday , and recession , which occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of economic decline .","1"
sociology," The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .","0"
sociology," 5624 . Sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of social standing .","0"
sociology," Social stratification refers to a society ’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth , income , race , education , and power .","1"
sociology," 5633 . This was generally a closed system , with people born into positions of nobility .","0"
sociology," Wealth was passed from generation to generation through primogeniture , a law stating that all property would be inherited by the firstborn son .","1"
sociology," If the family had no son , the land went to the next closest male relation .","0"
sociology," 5636 . Individuals can experience upward or downward social mobility for a variety of reasons .","0"
sociology," Upward mobility refers to an increase — or upward shift — in social class .","1"
sociology," In the United States , people applaud the rags - to - riches achievements of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Michael Jordan .","0"
sociology," 5642 . Global stratification compares the wealth , economic stability , status , and power of countries across the world .","1"
sociology," Global stratification highlights worldwide patterns of social inequality . In the early years of civilization , hunter - gatherer and agrarian societies lived off the earth and rarely interacted with other societies .","0"
sociology," 5645 . Just as the United States ' wealth is increasingly concentrated among its richest citizens while the middle class slowly disappears , global inequality is concentrating resources in certain nations and is significantly affecting the opportunities of individuals in poorer and less powerful countries .","1"
sociology," In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .","0"
sociology," 5648 . Familiar and still used by many , it classifies countries into first world , second world , and third world nations based on their respective economic development and standards of living .","0"
sociology," When this nomenclature was developed , capitalistic democracies such as the United States and Japan were considered part of the first world .","1"
sociology," The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .","1"
sociology," 5651 . The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .","1"
sociology," Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .","1"
sociology," Also during the Cold War , global inequality was described in terms of economic development .","0"
sociology," 5654 . We can be sure the workers in a Cuban cigar factory , for example , which are owned or leased by global core nation companies , are not enjoying the same privileges and rights as U.S. workers .","0"
sociology," Semi - peripheral nations are in - between nations , not powerful enough to dictate policy but nevertheless acting as a major source for raw material and an expanding middle - class marketplace for core nations , while also exploiting peripheral nations .","1"
sociology," Mexico is an example , providing abundant cheap agricultural labor to the U.S. , and supplying goods to the United States market at a rate dictated by the U.S. without the constitutional protections offered to United States workers .","0"
sociology," 5657 . Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .","1"
sociology," Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .","1"
sociology," As expected , global companies move their industrial processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost , including the building of infrastructure , training of workers , shipping of goods , and , of course , paying employee wages .","0"
sociology," 5660 . People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses”—the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors ’ standard of living to not feel deprived .","0"
sociology," But it is true that you might feel ” poor ” if you are living without a car to drive to and from work , without any money for a safety net should a family member fall ill , and without any “ extras ” beyond just making ends meet . Contrary to relative poverty , people who live in absolute poverty lack even the basic necessities , which typically include adequate food , clean water , safe housing , and access to healthcare .","1"
sociology," Absolute poverty is defined by the World Bank ( 2014a ) as when someone lives on less than $ 1.25 a day .","1"
sociology," 5666 . Dependency TheoryDependency theory was created in part as a response to the Western - centric mindset of modernization theory .","0"
sociology," It states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations ( or high - income nations ) exploiting semi - peripheral and peripheral nations ( or middle - income and low - income nations ) , which creates a cycle of dependence ( Hendricks 2010 ) .","1"
sociology," 5669 . Ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture — the practices , values , and beliefs of a group . This culture might include shared language , religion , and traditions , among other commonalities .","1"
sociology," 5672 . Let us explore the differences between these concepts .","0"
sociology," Stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of people .","1"
sociology," Stereotypes can be based on race , ethnicity , age , gender , sexual orientation — almost any characteristic .","0"
sociology," 5675 . The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .","1"
sociology," Institutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the fabric of society .","1"
sociology," For example , the disproportionate number of black men arrested , charged , and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling , a form of institutional racism .","0"
sociology," 5678 . For example , when a newspaper identifies by race individuals accused of a crime , it may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority .","0"
sociology," Another example of racist practices is racial steering , in which real estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race .","1"
sociology," Racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than specific racist practices .","0"
sociology," 5681 . Ferguson ’s racial imbalance may explain in part why , even though in 2010 only about 63 percent of its population was black , in 2013 blacks were detained in 86 percent of stops , 92 percent of searches , and 93 percent of arrests ( Missouri Attorney General ’s Office 2014 ) .","0"
sociology," In addition , de facto segregation in Ferguson ’s schools , a race - based wealth gap , urban sprawl , and a black unemployment rate three times that of the white unemployment rate worsened existing racial tensions in Ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities ( Bouie 2014).Multiple IdentitiesGolfer Tiger Woods has Chinese , Thai , African American , Native American , and Dutch heritage .","0"
sociology," Individuals with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more common .","0"
sociology," 5684 . Genocide , the deliberate annihilation of a targeted ( usually subordinate ) group , is the most toxic intergroup relationship .","1"
sociology," Historically , we can see that genocide has included both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group , intentional or not .","0"
sociology," 5687 . Pluralism is represented by the ideal of the United States as a “ salad bowl ” : a great mixture of different cultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the flavor of the whole .","0"
sociology," True pluralism is characterized by mutual respect on the part of all cultures , both dominant and subordinate , creating a multicultural environment of acceptance .","1"
sociology," 5690 . Asian Americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice , despite the seemingly positive stereotype as the model minority .","0"
sociology," The model minority stereotype is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching significant educational , professional , and socioeconomic levels without challenging the existing establishment .","1"
sociology," 5696 . Other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and LBGTQ , which stands for “ Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender ” ( and “ Queer ” or “ Questioning ” when the Q is added).Sociologically , it is clear that gay and lesbian couples are negatively affected in states where they are denied the legal right to marriage .","1"
sociology," In 1996 , The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) was passed , explicitly limiting the definition of “ marriage ” to a union between one man and one woman .","1"
sociology," It also allowed individual states to choose whether or not they recognized same - sex marriages performed in other states .","0"
sociology," 5699 . Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .","1"
sociology," Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .","1"
sociology," Transgender is not the same as homosexual , and many homosexual males view both their sex and gender as male .","0"
sociology," 5702 . Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism .","0"
sociology," Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another .","1"
sociology," It varies in its level of severity .","0"
sociology," 5705 . The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .","1"
sociology," This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .","0"
sociology," 5708 . Madame Jeanne Calment of France was the world 's oldest living person until she died at 122 years old ; there are currently six women in the world whose ages are well documented as 115 years or older ( Diebel 2014 ) .","0"
sociology," Supercentenarians are people living to 110 years or more .","1"
sociology," In August 2014 , there were seventy - five verified supercentenarians worldwide — seventy - three women and two men .","0"
sociology," 5711 . Social gerontology refers to a specialized field of gerontology that examines the social ( and sociological ) aspects of aging .","1"
sociology," Researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the experiences of people at specific ages , such as mental and physical wellbeing , plus age - specific concerns such as the process of dying .","0"
sociology," 5714 . Baby BoomersOf particular interest to gerontologists today is the population of baby boomers , the cohort born between 1946 and 1964 and now reaching their 60s .","1"
sociology," Coming of age in the 1960s and early 1970s , the baby boom generation was the first group of children and teenagers with their own spending power and therefore their own marketing power ( Macunovich 2000 ) .","0"
sociology," 5717 . It is helpful to understand aging in the context of these phases .","0"
sociology," A life course is the period from birth to death , including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical maturation .","1"
sociology," Each phase comes with different responsibilities and expectations , which of course vary by individual and culture .","0"
sociology," 5720 . For many teenagers and young adults , losing a grandparent or another older relative can be the first loss of a loved one they experience .","0"
sociology," It may be their first encounter with grief , a psychological , emotional , and social response to the feelings of loss that accompanies death or a similar event .","1"
sociology," 5723 . The changing concept of hospice is an indicator of our society ’s changing view of death .","0"
sociology," Hospice is a type of healthcare that treats terminally ill people when “ cure - oriented treatments ” are no longer an option ( Hospice Foundation of America 2012b ) .","1"
sociology," 5726 . In early societies , the elderly were respected and revered .","0"
sociology," Many preindustrial societies observed gerontocracy , a type of social structure wherein the power is held by a society ’s oldest members .","1"
sociology," In some countries today , the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is respected .","0"
sociology," 5729 . The social withdrawal that Cummings and Henry recognized ( 1961 ) , and its notion that elderly people need to find replacement roles for those they ’ve lost , is addressed anew in activity theory .","0"
sociology," According to this theory , activity levels and social involvement are key to this process , and key to happiness ( Havinghurst 1961 ; Neugarten 1964 ; Havinghurst , Neugarten , and Tobin 1968 ) .","1"
sociology," 5732 . Another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory ( Riley , Johnson , and Foner 1972 ) .","0"
sociology," Though it may seem obvious now , with our awareness of ageism , age stratification theorists were the first to suggest that members of society might be stratified by age , just as they are stratified by race , class , and gender .","0"
sociology," 5735 . Another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is selective optimization with compensation theory .","0"
sociology," Baltes and Baltes ( 1990 ) based their theory on the idea that successful personal development throughout the life course and subsequent mastery of the challenges associated with everyday life are based on the components of selection , optimization , and compensation .","1"
sociology," 5738 . Sociologists , on the other hand , tend to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict configuration of status roles .","0"
sociology," Here , we ’ll define family as a socially recognized group ( usually joined by blood , marriage , cohabitation , or adoption ) that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society .","1"
sociology," Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them .","0"
sociology," 5741 . Marriage PatternsWith single parenting and cohabitation ( when a couple shares a residence but not a marriage ) becoming more acceptable in recent years , people may be less motivated to get married .","1"
sociology," In a recent survey , 39 percent of respondents answered “ yes ” when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete ( Pew Research Center 2010 ) .","0"
sociology," 5744 . Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .","0"
sociology," Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time .","1"
sociology," The reverse , when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time , is called polyandry .","1"
sociology," 5747 . Both paternal and maternal ancestors are considered part of one ’s family .","1"
sociology," This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent .","0"
sociology," Note that kinship , or one ’s traceable ancestry , can be based on blood or marriage or adoption .","1"
sociology," 5750 . There are three types of unilateral descent : patrilineal , which follows the father ’s line only ; matrilineal , which follows the mother ’s side only ; and ambilineal , which follows either the father ’s only or the mother ’s side only , depending on the situation .","1"
sociology," In partrilineal societies , such as those in rural China and India , only males carry on the family surname .","0"
sociology," 5753 . Today , however , these models have been criticized for their linear and conventional assumptions as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms .","0"
sociology," While reviewing some of these once - popular theories , it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses . The set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family life cycle .","1"
sociology," One of the first designs of the family life cycle was developed by Paul Glick in 1955 .","0"
sociology," 5756 . Of these children , 54 percent live with grandparents , 21 percent live with other relatives , and 24 percent live with nonrelatives .","0"
sociology," This family structure is referred to as the extended family , and may include aunts , uncles , and cousins living in the same home .","0"
sociology," Foster parents account for about a quarter of nonrelatives .","0"
sociology," 5759 . Some people associate religion with places of worship ( a synagogue or church ) , others with a practice ( confession or meditation ) , and still others with a concept that guides their daily lives ( like dharma or sin ) .","0"
sociology," All these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs , values , and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant . Does religion bring fear , wonder , relief , explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice ?","1"
sociology," How do our religious perspectives affect our behavior ?","0"
sociology," 5762 . Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .","0"
sociology," Religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group , such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins ( Barkan and Greenwood 2003).The History of Religion as a Sociological ConceptIn the wake of nineteenth century European industrialization and secularization , three social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society : Émile Durkheim , Max Weber , and Karl Marx .","1"
sociology," They are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology .","0"
sociology," 5765 . Some sects do not grow into denominations .","1"
sociology," Sociologists call these established sects .","0"
sociology," Established sects , such as the Amish or Jehovah ’s Witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia – cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect - like and denomination - like characteristics .","0"
sociology," 5768 . Note that some religions may be practiced — or understood — in various categories .","0"
sociology," For instance , the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , Holy Spirit ) defies the definition of monotheism , which is a religion based on belief in a single deity , to some scholars .","0"
sociology," Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .","0"
sociology," 5771 . Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .","1"
sociology," It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .","1"
sociology," While typically not an organized group , atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population .","0"
sociology," 5774 . Education is a social institution through which a society ’s children are taught basic academic knowledge , learning skills , and cultural norms .","1"
sociology," Every nation in the world is equipped with some form of education system , though those systems vary greatly .","0"
sociology," 5777 . Cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values , beliefs , and social norms of their culture .","1"
sociology," Both informal and formal education include cultural transmission .","0"
sociology," 5780 . Another role of schools , according to functionalist theory , is that of sorting , or classifying students based on academic merit or potential .","0"
sociology," The most capable students are identified early in schools through testing and classroom achievements .","0"
sociology," 5783 . This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .","0"
sociology," Conflict theorists point to tracking , a formalized sorting system that places students on “ tracks ” ( advanced versus low achievers ) that perpetuate inequalities .","1"
sociology," While educators may believe that students do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from teachers , conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self - fulfilling prophecies in which students live up ( or down ) to teacher and societal expectations ( Education Week 2004 ) .","0"
sociology," 5786 . The findings in the Coleman Report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to education in the United States .","0"
sociology," The federal Head Start program , which is still active and successful today , was developed to give low - income students an opportunity to make up the preschool deficit discussed in Coleman ’s findings .","0"
sociology," The program provides academic - centered preschool to students of low socioeconomic status .","1"
sociology," 5789 . Government leaders might have this kind of influence as well , but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government .","0"
sociology," As this example indicates , there is more than one type of authority in a community . Authority refers to accepted power — that is , power that people agree to follow .","1"
sociology," People listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect .","0"
sociology," 5792 . Followers accept the power of charismatic authority because they are drawn to the leader ’s personal qualities .","0"
sociology," The appeal of a charismatic leader can be extraordinary , and can inspire followers to make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution .","0"
sociology," 5795 . The power held by these positions varies from one country to another .","0"
sociology," Strictly speaking , a monarchy is a government in which a single person ( a monarch ) rules until he or she dies or abdicates the throne .","1"
sociology," Usually , a monarch claims the rights to the title by way of hereditary succession or as a result of some sort of divine appointment or calling .","0"
sociology," 5798 . The power in an oligarchy is held by a small , elite group .","1"
sociology," Unlike in a monarchy , members of an oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their statuses based on ties to noble ancestry .","0"
sociology," 5801 . A democracy is a form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice , or vote , in determining state policy , regardless of their level of socioeconomic status .","1"
sociology," Another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of a just and comprehensive constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike .","0"
sociology," 5804 . Shortly before the Voting Rights Act was passed , the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims changed the nature of elections .","0"
sociology," This landmark decision reaffirmed the notion of “ one person , one vote , ” a concept holding that all people ’s votes should be counted equally .","1"
sociology," Before this decision , unequal distributions of population enabled small groups of people in sparsely populated rural areas to have as much voting power as the denser populations of urban areas .","0"
sociology," 5299 . In March 2014 , a group of musicians got together in a fish market in Odessa for a spontaneous performance of Beethoven 's “ Ode to Joy ” from his Ninth Symphony .","0"
sociology," While tensions were building over Ukraine 's efforts to join the European Union , and even as Russian troops had taken control of the Ukrainian airbase in Belbek , the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera Chorus tried to lighten the troubled times for shoppers with music and song . Spontaneous gatherings like this are called flash mobs .","0"
sociology," They often are captured on video and shared on the Internet ; frequently they go viral .","0"
sociology," 5302 . Turner and Killian ( 1993 ) identified four types of crowds .","0"
sociology," Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .","1"
sociology," Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .","1"
sociology," 5308 . They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior , especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors .","0"
sociology," Emergent norm theory asserts that , in this circumstance , people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular ( individual ) set of norms , which may change as the crowd experience evolves .","1"
sociology," This focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective . For Turner and Killian , the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation , or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar .","0"
sociology," 5311 . Social movements are purposeful , organized groups that strive to work toward a common social goal .","1"
sociology," While most of us learned about social movements in history classes , we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused — and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global social movements .","0"
sociology," 5314 . Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .","0"
sociology," Revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society .","1"
sociology," These include the 1960s counterculture movement , including the revolutionary group The Weather Underground , as well as anarchist collectives .","0"
sociology," 5320 . Churches and their ministers joined the struggle , and the protest organization In Friendship was formed as well as The Friendly Club and the Club From Nowhere .","0"
sociology," A social movement industry , which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are striving toward similar goals , was growing .","1"
sociology," Martin Luther King Jr. emerged during these events to become the charismatic leader of the movement , gained respect from elites in the federal government , and aided by even more emerging SMOs such as the Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , among others .","0"
sociology," Several still exist today .","0"
sociology," 5323 . As you can see , there may be many competing prognostic frames even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames .","0"
sociology," Finally , motivational framing is the call to action : what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the prognostic frame ?","1"
sociology," These frames are action - oriented .","0"
sociology," 5326 . Collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change , which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological innovations .","0"
sociology," Essentially , any disruptive shift in the status quo , be it intentional or random , human - caused or natural , can lead to social change .","0"
sociology," 5329 . Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .","1"
sociology," A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .","1"
sociology," 5332 . The term culture refers to the group ’s shared practices , values , and beliefs .","1"
sociology," Culture encompasses a group ’s way of life , from routine , everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members ' lives .","0"
sociology," 5335 . Some sociologists study social facts , which are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life , that may contribute to these changes in the family .","1"
sociology," Do people in the United States view marriage and family differently than before ?","0"
sociology," 5338 . He argued that how an individual comes to view himself or herself is based to a very large extent on interactions with others .","0"
sociology," Mead called specific individuals that impacted a person ’s life significant others , and he also conceptualized “ generalized others ” as the organized and generalized attitude of a social group .","1"
sociology," Mead ’s work is closely associated with the symbolic interactionist approach and emphasizes the micro - level of analysis .","0"
sociology," 5341 . The different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology .","0"
sociology," Quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants .","1"
sociology," Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .","0"
sociology," 5344 . For example , although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon , Émile Durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it .","0"
sociology," His studied social ties within a group , or social solidarity , and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion - based differences .","1"
sociology," Durkheim gathered a large amount of data about Europeans who had ended their lives , and he did indeed find differences based on religion .","0"
sociology," 5347 . Functionalism , also called structural - functional theory , sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society .","1"
sociology," Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .","0"
sociology," 5350 . Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .","0"
sociology," In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .","1"
sociology," 5353 . Latent functions can be beneficial , neutral , or harmful .","0"
sociology," Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions .","1"
sociology," In education , examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades , truancy , dropping out , not graduating , and not finding suitable employment .","0"
sociology," 5356 . For example , while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact , as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message .","0"
sociology," The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman ( 1922 – 1982 ) to develop a technique called dramaturgical analysis .","0"
sociology," Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people ’s interactions showed patterns of cultural “ scripts . ” Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds ( Goffman 1958 ) .","1"
sociology," Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods , such as in - depth interviews or participant observation , because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live .","0"
sociology," 5359 . Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .","0"
sociology," Researchers Rotton and Kelly ( 1985 ) conducted a meta - analysis of research on the full moon ’s effects on behavior .","0"
sociology," Meta - analysis is a technique in which the results of virtually all previous studies on a specific subject are evaluated together .","1"
sociology," 5362 . In this field , results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before — knowledge of other cultures , knowledge of rituals and beliefs , or knowledge of trends and attitudes .","0"
sociology," No matter what research approach they use , researchers want to maximize the study ’s reliability , which refers to how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced .","1"
sociology," Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .","0"
sociology," 5365 . The next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a literature review , which is a review of any existing similar or related studies .","0"
sociology," A visit to the library and a thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study .","0"
sociology," 5368 . In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .","1"
sociology," The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .","1"
sociology," 5371 . Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics and that fit with their overall approaches to research .","0"
sociology," In planning studies ' designs , sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation : survey , field research , experiment , and secondary data analysis , or use of existing sources .","0"
sociology," Every research method comes with plusses and minuses , and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use .","0"
sociology," Surveys","0"
sociology," 5374 . A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .","0"
sociology," Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .","1"
sociology," The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .","0"
sociology," 5377 . People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously .","0"
sociology," This type of information is qualitative data — results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting .","1"
sociology," Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate .","0"
sociology," 5380 . Much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation .","0"
sociology," And while field research looks for correlation , its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables .","0"
sociology," 5383 . Sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event .","0"
sociology," A case study is an in - depth analysis of a single event , situation , or individual .","1"
sociology," To conduct a case study , a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records , conducts interviews , engages in direct observation and even participant observation , if possible . Researchers might use this method to study a single case of , for example , a foster child , drug lord , cancer patient , criminal , or rape victim .","0"
sociology," 5386 . One of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive research ( or unobtrusive research ) , meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people ’s behaviors .","1"
sociology," Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people , using previously published data does n’t require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process .","0"
sociology," 5389 . While he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values , he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses .","0"
sociology," Sociologists , he stated , must establish value neutrality , a practice of remaining impartial , without bias or judgment , during the course of a study and in publishing results ( 1949 ) .","1"
sociology," Sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data .","0"
sociology," 5392 . Nonmaterial culture , in contrast , consists of the ideas , attitudes , and beliefs of a society .","1"
sociology," Material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked , and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas .","0"
sociology," 5395 . The first , and perhaps most crucial , elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs .","0"
sociology," Values are a culture ’s standard for discerning what is good and just in society .","1"
sociology," Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .","0"
sociology," 5398 . Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .","1"
sociology," But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .","1"
sociology," In an ideal culture , there would be no traffic accidents , murders , poverty , or racial tension .","0"
sociology," 5401 . These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured , or what sociologists call norms .","1"
sociology," Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good , right , and important , and most members of the society adhere to them .","0"
sociology," 5404 . Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by . Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways .","0"
sociology," Mores ( mor - ays ) are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group .","1"
sociology," Violating them can have serious consequences .","0"
sociology," 5407 . While different cultures have varying systems of symbols , one symbol is common to all : language .","0"
sociology," Language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted .","1"
sociology," Some languages contain a system of symbols used for written communication , while others rely on only spoken communication and nonverbal actions .","0"
sociology," 5410 . The term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in mainstream society .","1"
sociology," Popular culture events might include a parade , a baseball game , or the season finale of a television show .","0"
sociology," 5413 . An innovation refers to an object or concept ’s initial appearance in society — it ’s innovative because it is markedly new .","1"
sociology," There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea : discover it or invent it .","0"
sociology," 5416 . Material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture ; technology can spread through society in a matter of months , but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change .","0"
sociology," Sociologist William F. Ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture ( Ogburn 1957 ) .","1"
sociology," Culture lag can also cause tangible problems .","0"
sociology," 5419 . Exactly what is a society ?","0"
sociology," In sociological terms , society refers to a group of people who live in a definable community and share the same culture .","1"
sociology," On a broader scale , society consists of the people and institutions around us , our shared beliefs , and our cultural ideas .","0"
sociology," 5422 . Previously , the depletion of a region ’s crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their livestock .","0"
sociology," Horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to grow stable crops .","0"
sociology," They were similar to hunter - gatherers in that they largely depended on the environment for survival , but since they did n’t have to abandon their location to follow resources , they were able to start permanent settlements .","0"
sociology," 5425 . Postindustrial SocietyInformation societies , sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies , are a recent development .","0"
sociology," Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services .","1"
sociology," 5428 . In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .","0"
sociology," Durkheim also believed that social integration , or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups , was a key factor in social life .","1"
sociology," Following the ideas of Comte and Spencer , Durkheim likened society to a living organism , in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being alive .","0"
sociology," Even the socially deviant members of society are necessary , Durkheim argued , as punishments for deviance affirm established cultural values and norms .","0"
sociology," 5431 . Laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge .","0"
sociology," While the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is , in the long run , advantageous for a society , Durkheim noted that it can be a time of chaos and “ normlessness . ”","0"
sociology," One of the outcomes of the transition is something he called social anomie .","0"
sociology," Anomie — literally , “ without law ” — is a situation in which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness .","1"
sociology," 5434 . Marx described modern society in terms of alienation .","0"
sociology," Alienation refers to the condition in which the individual is isolated and divorced from his or her society , work , or the sense of self .","1"
sociology," Marx defined four specific types of alienation .","0"
sociology," 5437 . Weber ’s analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization .","0"
sociology," A rational society is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition .","1"
sociology," 5440 . In a sense , it exists by consensus , both prior and current .","0"
sociology," This is an example of the process of institutionalization , the act of implanting a convention or norm into society .","1"
sociology," Bear in mind that the institution , while socially constructed , is still quite real .","0"
sociology," 5443 . Roles and StatusAs you can imagine , people employ many types of behaviors in day - to - day life .","0"
sociology," Roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person ’s social status .","1"
sociology," Currently , while reading this text , you are playing the role of a student .","0"
sociology," 5446 . Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .","1"
sociology," Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .","1"
sociology," As a daughter or son , you occupy a different status than as a neighbor or employee .","0"
sociology," 5449 . Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .","0"
sociology," Similarly , a person can experience role conflict when one or more roles are contradictory .","0"
sociology," A parent who also has a full - time career can experience role conflict on a daily basis .","0"
sociology," 5455 . In the 1850s , as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved , suburbs developed .","0"
sociology," Suburbs are the communities surrounding cities , typically close enough for a daily commute in , but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords .","1"
sociology," The bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl .","0"
sociology," 5458 . Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .","0"
sociology," New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .","1"
sociology," These metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the U.S. landscape . The suburban sprawl in Toronto means long commutes and traffic congestion .","0"
sociology," 5461 . The world ’s most densely populated cities are now largely concentrated in the global south , a marked change from several decades ago when the biggest cities were found in the global north .","0"
sociology," In the next forty years , the biggest global challenge for urbanized populations , particularly in less developed countries , will be to achieve development that occurs without depleting or damaging the natural environment , also called sustainable development ( United Nations , Department of Economic and Social Affairs , Population Division 2014 ) .","1"
sociology," 5464 . The subfield of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments .","1"
sociology," This field is closely related to human ecology , which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment .","1"
sociology," 5467 . And it is far more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the environment .","0"
sociology," E - waste is the name for obsolete , broken , and worn - out electronics — from computers to mobile phones to televisions .","1"
sociology," The challenge is that these products , which are multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence ( the designing of products to quickly become outdated and then be replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper electronics ) , have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them , which makes for a dangerous combination .","1"
sociology," 5470 . Without regular interaction — the holding , hugging , talking , the explanations and demonstrations given to most young children — she had not learned to walk or to speak , to eat or to interact , to play or even to understand the world around her .","0"
sociology," From a sociological point of view , Danielle had not been socialized .","0"
sociology," Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society .","1"
sociology," It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values .","0"
sociology," 5473 . Sociologists measure fertility using the crude birthrate ( the number of live births per 1,000 people per year ) .","1"
sociology," Just as fertility measures childbearing , the mortality rate is a measure of the number of people who die .","1"
sociology," The crude death rate is a number derived from the number of deaths per 1,000 people per year .","1"
sociology," 5482 . Moral development is an important part of the socialization process .","0"
sociology," The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society .","1"
sociology," 5485 . Fracking , another word for hydraulic fracturing , is a method used to recover gas and oil from shale by drilling down into the earth and directing a high - pressure mixture of water , sand , and proprietary chemicals into the rock .","1"
sociology," Commonly , this process also includes drilling horizontally into the rock to create new pathways for gas to travel .","0"
sociology," 5488 . First , members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a degradation ceremony .","0"
sociology," In a degradation ceremony , new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new identities .","1"
sociology," The process is sometimes gentle .","0"
sociology," 5494 . Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .","1"
sociology," These people are considered a category , and as an example all children born from approximately 1980–2000 are referred to as “ Millennials . ”","1"
sociology," Why are Millennials a category and not a group ?","0"
sociology," Because while some of them may share a sense of identity , they do not , as a whole , interact frequently with each other . Interestingly , people within an aggregate or category can become a group .","0"
sociology," 5497 . They may also be task - focused and time - limited .","0"
sociology," These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal- or task - oriented than emotional .","0"
sociology," A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group .","0"
sociology," 5500 . A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad .","1"
sociology," Georg Simmel ( 1858 – 1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two - member group , and a triad , which is a three - member group ( Simmel 1902 ) .","1"
sociology," In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist .","0"
sociology," 5506 . A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution .","0"
sociology," In contrast , a laissez - faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands - off , allowing group members to self - manage and make their own decisions .","1"
sociology," An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art .","0"
sociology," 5512 . The Audubon Society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations .","0"
sociology," Coercive organizations are groups that we must be coerced , or pushed , to join .","1"
sociology," These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .","0"
sociology," 5515 . People often complain about bureaucracies –– declaring them slow , rule - bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly .","0"
sociology," Let ’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors .","1"
sociology," For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks .","0"
sociology," 5518 . Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations .","1"
sociology," This characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism , backroom deals , and other types of favoritism , simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization .","0"
sociology," 5521 . The McDonaldization of Society ( Ritzer 1993 ) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions .","1"
sociology," This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) .","0"
sociology," 5524 . All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .","1"
sociology," The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .","0"
sociology," Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .","0"
sociology," 5527 . A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .","0"
sociology," Negative sanctions are punishments for violating norms .","1"
sociology," Being arrested is a punishment for shoplifting .","0"
sociology," 5530 . Sociologist Robert Merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of a functioning society , but he expanded on Durkheim ’s ideas by developing strain theory , which notes that access to socially acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person conforms or deviates .","1"
sociology," From birth , we ’re encouraged to achieve the “ American Dream ” of financial success .","0"
sociology," 5533 . Conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance .","1"
sociology," Unlike functionalists , conflict theorists do n’t see these factors as positive functions of society .","0"
sociology," 5536 . Those who do , however , have often been labeled “ deviant ” by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves .","0"
sociology," Labeling theory examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person by members of society .","1"
sociology," Thus , what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them , but by the reactions of others to these behaviors .","0"
sociology," 5545 . If you use a crowbar to break into a car , you are committing a nonviolent crime ; if you mug someone with the crowbar , you are committing a violent crime .","0"
sociology," When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .","0"
sociology," An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .","1"
sociology," 5548 . Both victims were drugged , sodomized , and forced to burn one another with cigarettes .","0"
sociology," When questioned by police , the ringleader of the crime explained that the victims were gay and “ looked like [ they ] liked it ” ( Wilson and Baker 2010 ) .","0"
sociology," Attacks based on a person ’s race , religion , or other characteristics are known as hate crimes .","1"
sociology," Hate crimes in the United States evolved from the time of early European settlers and their violence toward Native Americans .","0"
sociology," 5551 . Police are a civil force in charge of enforcing laws and public order at a federal , state , or community level .","1"
sociology," No unified national police force exists in the United States , although there are federal law enforcement officers .","0"
sociology," 5554 . It is easy to look at the latest sleek Apple product and think technology is a recent addition to our world .","0"
sociology," But from the steam engine to the most cutting - edge robotic surgery tools , technology has described the application of science to address the problems of daily life .","0"
sociology," We might look back at the enormous and clunky computers of the 1970s that had about as much storage as an iPod Shuffle and roll our eyes in disbelief .","0"
sociology," 5557 . Numerous facts sheets available through the government , nonprofits , and the private sector outline common safety measures , including the following : become familiar with privacy rights ; read privacy policies when making a purchase ( rather than simply clicking “ accept ” ) ; give out only the minimum information requested by any source ; ask why information is being collected , how it is going to be used , and who will have access it ; and monitor your credit history for red flags that indicate your identity has been compromised .","0"
sociology," Net Neutrality","0"
sociology," The issue of net neutrality , the principle that all Internet data should be treated equally by Internet service providers , is part of the national debate about Internet access and the digital divide .","0"
sociology," On one side of this debate is the belief that those who provide Internet service , like those who provide electricity and water , should be treated as common carriers , legally prohibited from discriminating based on the customer or nature of the goods .","0"
sociology," 5560 . Theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system , as with most other social problems , are rooted in capitalist society .","0"
sociology," According to conflict theorists , capitalism and the pursuit of profit lead to the commodification of health : the changing of something not generally thought of as a commodity into something that can be bought and sold in a marketplace .","0"
sociology," In this view , people with money and power — the dominant group — are the ones who make decisions about how the healthcare system will be run .","0"
sociology," 5563 . Healthcare U.S.","0"
sociology," healthcare coverage can broadly be divided into two main categories : public healthcare ( government - funded ) and private healthcare ( privately funded ) .","0"
sociology," The two main publicly funded healthcare programs are Medicare , which provides health services to people over sixty - five years old as well as people who meet other standards for disability , and Medicaid , which provides services to people with very low incomes who meet other eligibility requirements .","1"
sociology," 5566 . One critique of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is that it will create a system of socialized medicine , a term that for many people in the United States has negative connotations lingering from the Cold War era and earlier .","0"
sociology," Under a socialized medicine system , the government owns and runs the system .","1"
sociology," It employs the doctors , nurses , and other staff , and it owns and runs the hospitals ( Klein 2009 ) .","0"
sociology," 5569 . The discrepancy between black and white Americans shows the gap clearly ; in 2008 , the average life expectancy for white males was approximately five years longer than for black males : 75.9 compared to 70.9 .","0"
sociology," An even stronger disparity was found in 2007 : the infant mortality , which is the number of deaths in a given time or place , rate for blacks was nearly twice that of whites at 13.2 compared to 5.6 per 1,000 live births ( U.S. Census Bureau 2011 ) .","0"
sociology," According to a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation ( 2007 ) , African Americans also have higher incidence of several other diseases and causes of mortality , from cancer to heart disease to diabetes .","0"
sociology," 5572 . In the post - millennial United States , those of us who have never experienced such a disadvantage take for granted the rights our society guarantees for each citizen .","0"
sociology," We do not think about the relatively recent nature of the protections , unless , of course , we know someone constantly inconvenienced by the lack of accommodations or misfortune of suddenly experiencing a temporary disability .","0"
sociology," Mental HealthPeople with mental disorders ( a condition that makes it more difficult to cope with everyday life ) and people with mental illness ( a severe , lasting mental disorder that requires long - term treatment ) experience a wide range of effects .","1"
sociology," According to the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , the most common mental disorders in the United States are anxiety disorders .","0"
sociology," Almost 18 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected in a single year , and 28 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .","0"
sociology," 5575 . Disability refers to a reduction in one ’s ability to perform everyday tasks .","1"
sociology," The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .","0"
sociology," 5578 . Even after slavery was abolished in 1865 , the next 100 years of U.S. history saw institutionalized racism and prejudice against black people .","0"
sociology," In an example of stereotype interchangeability , the same insults that are flung today at the overweight and obese population ( lazy , for instance ) , have been flung at various racial and ethnic groups in earlier history .","0"
sociology," Of course , no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public now , except when talking about obese people .","0"
sociology," Why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward — even to hate — obese people ?","0"
sociology," 5581 . In essence , Goffman ( 1963 ) suggests we might view illness as a stigma that can push others to view the ill in an undesirable manner .","0"
sociology," The stigmatization of illness often has the greatest effect on the patient and the kind of care he or she receives .","0"
sociology," Many contend that our society and even our healthcare institutions discriminate against certain diseases — like mental disorders , AIDS , venereal diseases , and skin disorders ( Sartorius 2007 ) .","0"
sociology," 5584 . This regulatory body will patent three types of innovation .","0"
sociology," Utility patents are the first type .","0"
sociology," These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .","1"
sociology," 5587 . Anderson and Tushman ( 1990 ) suggest an evolutionary model of technological change , in which a breakthrough in one form of technology leads to a number of variations .","1"
sociology," Once those are assessed , a prototype emerges , and then a period of slight adjustments to the technology , interrupted by a breakthrough .","0"
sociology," 5590 . In this section , we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective .","0"
sociology," As the names suggest , media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross - cultural exchange of ideas , while technological globalization refers to the cross - cultural development and exchange of technology .","1"
sociology," 5593 . Technological globalization is speeded in large part by technological diffusion , the spread of technology across borders .","1"
sociology," In the last two decades , there has been rapid improvement in the spread of technology to peripheral and semi - peripheral nations , and a 2008 World Bank report discusses both the benefits and ongoing challenges of this diffusion .","0"
sociology," 5596 . Social scientists take the idea of the surveillance society so seriously that there is an entire journal devoted to its study , Surveillance and Society .","0"
sociology," The panoptic surveillance envisioned by Jeremy Bentham , depicted in the form of an all - powerful , all - seeing government by George Orwell in 1984 , and later analyzed by Michel Foucault ( 1975 ) is increasingly realized in the form of technology used to monitor our every move .","0"
sociology," This surveillance was imagined as a form of constant monitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is never communicated with directly .","0"
sociology," 5599 . Neo - Luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life .","1"
sociology," But for technophiles , technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future .","1"
sociology," For those adopting an ideological middle ground , technology might symbolize status ( in the form of a massive flat - screen television ) or failure ( ownership of a basic old mobile phone with no bells or whistles ) .","0"
sociology," Social Construction of Reality","0"
sociology," 5602 . Despite the ongoing economic recovery , the job market is actually growing in some areas , but in a very polarized fashion .","0"
sociology," Polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market , with most employment opportunities at the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with midlevel skills and education .","1"
sociology," At one end , there has been strong demand for low - skilled , low - paying jobs in industries like food service and retail .","0"
sociology," 5608 . For example , in maquiladoras , mostly found in northern Mexico , workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments . Globalization also brings an international division of labor , in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low - wage labor pool of peripheral and semi - peripheral nations .","1"
sociology," This can lead to a sense of xenophobia , which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners and foreign goods .","1"
sociology," Corporations trying to maximize their profits in the United States are conscious of this risk and attempt to “ Americanize ” their products , selling shirts printed with U.S. flags that were nevertheless made in Mexico .","0"
sociology," 5611 . Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .","0"
sociology," Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .","1"
sociology," The complex U.S. economy , and the economies of other industrialized nations , meet the definition of organic solidarity .","0"
sociology," 5614 . Governments tried to protect their share of the markets by developing a system called mercantilism .","0"
sociology," Mercantilism is an economic policy based on accumulating silver and gold by controlling colonial and foreign markets through taxes and other charges .","1"
sociology," The resulting restrictive practices and exacting demands included monopolies , bans on certain goods , high tariffs , and exclusivity requirements .","0"
sociology," 5617 . Socialism is an economic system in which there is government ownership ( often referred to as “ state run ” ) of goods and their production , with an impetus to share work and wealth equally among the members of a society .","1"
sociology," Under socialism , everything that people produce , including services , is considered a social product .","0"
sociology," 5620 . Convergence theory explains that as a country 's economy grows , its societal organization changes to become more like that of an industrialized society .","1"
sociology," Rather than staying in one job for a lifetime , people begin to move from job to job as conditions improve and opportunities arise .","0"
sociology," 5623 . Those working in the symbolic interaction perspective take a microanalytical view of society .","0"
sociology," They focus on the way reality is socially constructed through day - to - day interaction and how society is composed of people communicating based on a shared understanding of symbols .","0"
sociology," One important symbolic interactionist concept related to work and the economy is career inheritance .","0"
sociology," This concept means simply that children tend to enter the same or similar occupation as their parents , which is a correlation that has been demonstrated in research studies ( Antony 1998 ) .","1"
sociology," 5626 . Caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing .","1"
sociology," A caste system is one in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives .","1"
sociology," People are assigned occupations regardless of their talents , interests , or potential .","0"
sociology," 5632 . Status Consistency","0"
sociology," Social stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income , education , and occupation .","0"
sociology," Sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency , or lack thereof , of an individual ’s rank across these factors .","1"
sociology," Caste systems correlate with high status consistency , whereas the more flexible class system has lower status consistency .","0"
sociology," 5635 . Social MobilitySocial mobility refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system .","1"
sociology," When people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class , they experience social mobility .","0"
sociology," 5638 . Dropping out of school , losing a job , or getting a divorce may result in a loss of income or status and , therefore , downward social mobility . It is not uncommon for different generations of a family to belong to varying social classes .","1"
sociology," This is known as intergenerational mobility .","0"
sociology," For example , an upper - class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class .","0"
sociology," 5641 . Class traits , also called class markers , are the typical behaviors , customs , and norms that define each class .","1"
sociology," Class traits indicate the level of exposure a person has to a wide range of cultures .","0"
sociology," 5644 . To symbolically communicate social standing , people often engage in conspicuous consumption , which is the purchase and use of certain products to make a social statement about status .","1"
sociology," Carrying pricey but eco - friendly water bottles could indicate a person ’s social standing .","0"
sociology," 5647 . While stratification in the United States refers to the unequal distribution of resources among individuals , global stratification refers to this unequal distribution among nations .","0"
sociology," There are two dimensions to this stratification : gaps between nations and gaps within nations .","0"
sociology," 5650 . The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .","1"
sociology," The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .","1"
sociology," Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .","0"
sociology," 5653 . For example , Wallerstein contends that the United States is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far - reaching implications , thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations .","0"
sociology," We can look at free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) as an example of how a core nation is able to leverage its power to gain the most advantageous position in the matter of global trade .","0"
sociology," Peripheral nations have very little industrialization ; what they do have often represents the outdated castoffs of core nations or the factories and means of production owned by core nations .","0"
sociology," They typically have unstable governments , inadequate social programs , and are economically dependent on core nations for jobs and aid .","0"
sociology," 5656 . Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2014b ) .","0"
sociology," High - income countries face two major issues : capital flight and deindustrialization .","0"
sociology," Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .","1"
sociology," Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .","1"
sociology," 5659 . Social scientists define global poverty in different ways and take into account the complexities and the issues of relativism described above .","0"
sociology," Relative poverty is a state of living where people can afford necessities but are unable to meet their society ’s average standard of living .","1"
sociology," People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses ” — the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors ’ standard of living to not feel deprived .","0"
sociology," 5662 . What do the driver of an unlicensed hack cab in New York , a piecework seamstress working from her home in Mumbai , and a street tortilla vendor in Mexico City have in common ?","0"
sociology," They are all members of the underground economy , a loosely defined unregulated market unhindered by taxes , government permits , or human protections .","1"
sociology," Official statistics before the worldwide recession posit that the underground economy accounted for over 50 percent of nonagricultural work in Latin America ; the figure went as high as 80 percent in parts of Asia and Africa ( Chen 2001 ) .","0"
sociology," 5665 . According to modernization theory , low - income countries are affected by their lack of industrialization and can improve their global economic standing through ( Armer and Katsillis 2010 ) : an adjustment of cultural values and attitudes to work","1"
sociology," 5668 . Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions ( Mongolia and the Caucus Mountains , for instance ) or skin tones ( black , white , yellow , and red , for example ) .","0"
sociology," Social science organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists , the American Sociological Association , and the American Psychological Association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological explanations of race .","0"
sociology," Over time , the typology of race that developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse , and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories .","0"
sociology," Research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were arbitrarily assigned , based on pseudoscience , and used to justify racist practices ( Omi and Winant 1994 ; Graves 2003 ) .","0"
sociology," 5671 . Scapegoat theory , developed initially from Dollard ’s ( 1939 ) Frustration - Aggression theory , suggests that the dominant group will displace its unfocused aggression onto a subordinate group .","1"
sociology," History has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group .","0"
sociology," 5674 . A prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a prejudgment , originating outside actual experience .","1"
sociology," A 1970 documentary called Eye of the Storm illustrates the way in which prejudice develops , by showing how defining one category of people as superior ( children with blue eyes ) results in prejudice against people who are not part of the favored category .","0"
sociology," While prejudice is not necessarily specific to race , racism is a stronger type of prejudice used to justify the belief that one racial category is somehow superior or inferior to others ; it is also a set of practices used by a racial majority to disadvantage a racial minority .","1"
sociology," The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .","0"
sociology," 5677 . While prejudice refers to biased thinking , discrimination consists of actions against a group of people .","1"
sociology," Discrimination can be based on age , religion , health , and other indicators ; race - based laws against discrimination strive to address this set of social problems .","0"
sociology," 5680 . In the days after , it was revealed that only three members of the town ’s fifty - three - member police force were black ( Nobles and Bosman 2014 ) .","0"
sociology," The national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks , with some commentators pointing to a nationwide sedimentation of racial inequality and identifying redlining in Ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced racial composition in the community , in local political establishments , and in the police force ( Bouie 2014 ) .","0"
sociology," Redlining is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages for households and businesses located in predominately minority communities , while sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of both practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of black people to accumulate wealth .","1"

sociology," We grow up surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions of racism and prejudice .","0"
sociology," 5686 . Segregation refers to the physical separation of two groups , particularly in residence , but also in workplace and social functions .","1"
sociology," It is important to distinguish between de jure segregation ( segregation that is enforced by law ) and de facto segregation ( segregation that occurs without laws but because of other factors ) .","1"
sociology," 5689 . Amalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new group .","1"
sociology," Amalgamation creates the classic “ melting pot ” analogy ; unlike the “ salad bowl , ” in which each culture retains its individuality , the “ melting pot ” ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely .","0"
sociology," Amalgamation , also known as miscegenation , is achieved through intermarriage between races .","0"
sociology," 5692 . Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity .","1"
sociology," Gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society attributes to being female or male .","1"
sociology," A person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .","0"
sociology," Therefore , the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable .","0"
sociology," 5695 . Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation .","0"
sociology," Some is based on heterosexism , which Herek ( 1990 ) suggests is both an ideology and a set of institutional practices that privilege heterosexuals and heterosexuality over other sexual orientations .","1"
sociology," Much like racism and sexism , heterosexism is a systematic disadvantage embedded in our social institutions , offering power to those who conform to hetereosexual orientation while simultaneously disadvantaging those who do not .","0"
sociology," 5698 . To a certain extent , men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity .","0"
sociology," Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .","1"
sociology," Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .","1"
sociology," 5701 . Gender Dysphoria , on the other hand , removes some of that stigma by taking the word "" disorder "" out while maintaining a category that will protect patient access to care , including hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery .","0"
sociology," In the DSM-5 , Gender Dysphoria is a condition of people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with .","1"
sociology," For a person to be diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria , there must be a marked difference between the individual ’s expressed / experienced gender and the gender others would assign him or her , and it must continue for at least six months .","0"
sociology," 5704 . In other words , both gender and sexuality are socially constructed .","0"
sociology," The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .","1"
sociology," This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .","0"
sociology," 5707 . Queer TheoryQueer Theory is an interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies Western society ’s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and questions the manner in which we have been taught to think about sexual orientation .","1"
sociology," According to Jagose ( 1996 ) , Queer [ Theory ] focuses on mismatches between anatomical sex , gender identity , and sexual orientation , not just division into male / female or homosexual / hetereosexual .","0"
sociology," 5710 . Gerontology is a field of science that seeks to understand the process of aging and the challenges encountered as seniors grow older .","1"
sociology," Gerontologists investigate age , aging , and the aged .","0"
sociology," 5719 . Each person experiences age - related changes based on many factors .","0"
sociology," Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging , while aging that occurs due to controllable factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging ( Whitbourne and Whitbourne 2010 ) .","1"
sociology," 5722 . Should patients have the right to choose to die with dignity ?","0"
sociology," Dr. Jack Kevorkian was a staunch advocate for physician - assisted suicide : the voluntary or physician - assisted use of lethal medication provided by a medical doctor to end one ’s life .","1"
sociology," This right to have a doctor help a patient die with dignity is controversial .","0"
sociology," 5725 . He did n’t intend to treat people differently based on personal or cultural biases , but he did .","0"
sociology," Ageism is discrimination ( when someone acts on a prejudice ) based on age .","1"
sociology," Dr. Robert Butler coined the term in 1968 , noting that ageism exists in all cultures ( Brownell ) .","0"
sociology," 5731 . There are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective .","0"
sociology," Modernization theory ( Cowgill and Holmes 1972 ) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization .","1"
sociology," As societies modernize , the status of elders decreases , and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion .","0"
sociology," 5734 . One microanalytical theory is Rose ’s ( 1962 ) subculture of aging theory , which focuses on the shared community created by the elderly when they are excluded ( due to age ) , voluntarily or involuntarily , from participating in other groups .","1"
sociology," This theory suggests that elders will disengage from society and develop new patterns of interaction with peers who share common backgrounds and interests .","0"
sociology," 5740 . A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born .","0"
sociology," A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage .","0"
sociology," These distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage . Drawing on two sociological paradigms , the sociological understanding of what constitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism .","0"
sociology," 5743 . In many countries and cultures around the world , however , having one spouse is not the only form of marriage .","0"
sociology," In a majority of cultures ( 78 percent ) , polygamy , or being married to more than one person at a time , is accepted ( Murdock 1967 ) , with most polygamous societies existing in northern Africa and east Asia ( Altman and Ginat 1996 ) .","1"
sociology," Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .","0"
sociology," 5746 . In the United States , polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable and it is illegal .","0"
sociology," The act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as bigamy and is considered a felony in most states .","1"
sociology," Polygamy in the United States is often associated with those of the Mormon faith , although in 1890 the Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy .","0"
sociology," 5749 . Sixty percent of societies , mostly modernized nations , follow a bilateral descent pattern .","0"
sociology," Unilateral descent ( the tracing of kinship through one parent only ) is practiced in the other 40 percent of the world ’s societies , with high concentration in pastoral cultures ( O’Neal 2006 ) .","1"
sociology," 5752 . Patrilocal residence is thought to be disadvantageous to women because it makes them outsiders in the home and community ; it also keeps them disconnected from their own blood relatives .","0"
sociology," In China , where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common , the written symbols for maternal grandmother ( wáipá ) are separately translated to mean “ outsider ” and “ women ” ( Cohen 2011 ) .","0"
sociology," Similarly , in matrilocal residence systems , where it is customary for the husband to live with his wife ’s blood relatives ( or her family of orientation ) , the husband can feel disconnected and can be labeled as an outsider .","1"
sociology," The Minangkabau people , a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands of West Sumatra in Indonesia , believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power in issues relating to the home or family ( Joseph and Najmabadi 2003 ) .","0"
sociology," 5755 . This is a decrease from 77 percent in 1980 ( U.S. Census 2011 ) .","0"
sociology," This two - parent family structure is known as a nuclear family , referring to married parents and children as the nucleus , or core , of the group .","1"
sociology," Recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married .","0"
sociology," 5761 . Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “ the divine . ”","1"
sociology," This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate .","0"
sociology," Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true , such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God , or that reincarnation exists .","1"
sociology," Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .","0"
sociology," 5767 . The term ecclesia , originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient Athens , Greece , now refers to a congregation .","0"
sociology," In sociology , the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to .","1"
sociology," 5770 . Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .","1"
sociology," Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .","1"
sociology," It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .","1"
sociology," 5773 . A megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than 2,000 people who attend regular weekly services .","1"
sociology," As of 2009 , the largest megachurch in the United States was in Houston Texas , boasting an average weekly attendance of more than 43,000 ( Bogan 2009 ) .","0"
sociology," 5776 . In contrast , informal education describes learning about cultural values , norms , and expected behaviors by participating in a society .","1"
sociology," This type of learning occurs both through the formal education system and at home .","0"
sociology," 5779 . Education also provides one of the major methods used by people for upward social mobility .","0"
sociology," This function is referred to as social placement .","0"
sociology," College and graduate schools are viewed as vehicles for moving students closer to the careers that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek .","0"
sociology," 5782 . Many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence .","0"
sociology," The cycle of rewarding those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational curricula as well as in the hidden curriculum , which refers to the type of nonacademic knowledge that students learn through informal learning and cultural transmission .","1"
sociology," This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .","0"
sociology," 5785 . The labeling with which symbolic interactionists concern themselves extends to the very degrees that symbolize completion of education .","0"
sociology," Credentialism embodies the emphasis on certificates or degrees to show that a person has a certain skill , has attained a certain level of education , or has met certain job qualifications .","1"
sociology," These certificates or degrees serve as a symbol of what a person has achieved , and allows the labeling of that individual .","0"
sociology," 5788 . opined , “ The measure of a man is what he does with power , ” and Lord Acton perhaps more famously asserted , “ Power tends to corrupt ; absolute power corrupts absolutely ” ( 1887 ) .","0"
sociology," Indeed , the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations , and the term itself is difficult to define .","0"
sociology," Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber , who said that power is the ability to exercise one ’s will over others ( Weber 1922 ) .","1"
sociology," Power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , professional organizations , and governments .","0"
sociology," 5794 . Most people generally agree that anarchy , or the absence of organized government , does not facilitate a desirable living environment for society , but it is much harder for individuals to agree upon the particulars of how a population should be governed .","1"
sociology," Throughout history , various forms of government have evolved to suit the needs of changing populations and mindsets , each with pros and cons .","0"
sociology," 5797 . In today ’s global political climate , monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional monarchies , governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the laws of a greater constitution .","1"
sociology," Many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from governments that were once considered absolute monarchies .","0"
sociology," 5800 . The late Kim Jong - Il , North Korean dictator , and his successor , Kim Jong - Un , exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship . Some dictatorships do not align themselves with any particular belief system or ideology ; the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator .","0"
sociology," A totalitarian dictatorship is even more oppressive and attempts to control all aspects of its subjects ’ lives ; including occupation , religious beliefs , and number of children permitted in each family .","1"
sociology," Citizens may be forced to publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in marches and demonstrations .","0"
sociology," 5803 . Political science looks at politics as the interaction between citizens and their government .","0"
sociology," Sociology studies politics as a means to understand the underlying social norms and values of a group .","1"
sociology," A society ’s political structure and practices provide insight into the distribution of power and wealth , as well as larger philosophical and cultural beliefs .","0"
government," 5808 . At this time , the idea of liberty became an important concept .","0"
government," According to John Locke , an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century , all people have natural rights to life , liberty , and property .","0"
government," From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed .","0"
government," 5811 . In socialist countries , the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity , transportation systems like airlines and railroads , and telecommunications systems .","0"
government," In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy : only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government .","1"
government," For example , in China , the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party .","0"
government," 5820 . Thus , U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress , the president and vice president , members of state legislatures , governors , mayors , and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf .","0"
government," Most representative governments favor majority rule : the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority .","1"
government," If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it , the law will be enacted .","0"
government," 5823 . At the other end of the political spectrum are elite - driven forms of government .","0"
government," In a monarchy , one ruler , usually a hereditary ruler , holds political power .","1"
government," Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law , and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country , this is not always the case .","0"
government," 5826 . This belief is called the elite theory of government .","0"
government," In contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government , which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government .","1"
government," Pluralist theorists assume that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government .","0"
government," 5829 . Rather than resting in the hands of individuals , a variety of organized groups hold power , with some groups having more influence on certain issues than others .","0"
government," Thousands of interest groups exist in the United States .","0"

government," The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .","1"
government," Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .","0"
government," 5835 . Are fewer people today active in politics than in the past ?","0"
government," Political scientist Robert Putnam has argued that civic engagement is declining ; although many Americans may report belonging to groups , these groups are usually large , impersonal ones with thousands of members .","0"
government," People who join groups such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace may share certain values and ideals with other members of the group , but they do not actually interact with these other members .","0"
government," 5838 . They argued that it was unfair to deny eighteen - year - olds the right to vote for the people who had the power to send them to war .","0"
government," As a result , the Twenty - Sixth Amendment , which lowered the voting age in national elections to eighteen , was ratified by the states and went into effect in 1971 .","1"
government," 5841 . Some people prefer even more active and direct forms of engagement such as protest marches and demonstrations , including civil disobedience .","0"
government," Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today .","0"
government," 5850 . The beliefs and attitudes that led to the call for independence had long been an important part of colonial life .","0"
government," Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government , the most important is surely John Locke ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," The most significant contributions of Locke , a seventeenth - century English philosopher , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be God - given rights to life , liberty , and property .","0"
government," 5853 . So committed were the British to the protection of these natural rights that when the royal Stuart dynasty began to intrude upon them in the seventeenth century , Parliament removed King James II , already disliked because he was Roman Catholic , in the Glorious Revolution and invited his Protestant daughter and her husband to rule the nation .","0"
government," Before offering the throne to William and Mary , however , Parliament passed the English Bill of Rights in 1689 .","0"
government," A bill of rights is a list of the liberties and protections possessed by a nation ’s citizens .","1"
government," 5859 . The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act , passed in 1765 , which required that almost all paper goods , such as diplomas , land deeds , contracts , and newspapers , have revenue stamps placed on them .","1"
government," The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .","0"

government," 5865 . These acts virtually abolished town meetings in Massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony ’s ability to govern itself .","0"
government," This assault on Massachusetts and its economy enraged people throughout the colonies , and delegates from all the colonies except Georgia formed the First Continental Congress to create a unified opposition to Great Britain .","0"
government," Among other things , members of the institution developed a declaration of rights and grievances .","0"
government," 5868 . Congress drafted a Declaration of Causes explaining the colonies ’ reasons for rebellion .","0"
government," On July 2 , 1776 , Congress declared American independence from Britain and two days later signed the Declaration of Independence .","1"
government," 5874 . Thus , powers given to the central government were severely limited .","0"
government," The Confederation Congress , formerly the Continental Congress , had the authority to exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and Indian tribes , declare war , coin currency and borrow money , and settle disputes between states .","1"
government," Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress ; these men could be recalled at any time .","0"
government," 5877 . The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , already recognized by many , became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers , led by Daniel Shays .","1"
government," Known as Shays ’ Rebellion , the incident panicked the governor of Massachusetts , who called upon the national government for assistance .","0"
government," However , with no power to raise an army , the government had no troops at its disposal .","0"
government," 5880 . All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting , a total of seventy men in all , but many did not attend .","0"
government," Among those not in attendance were John Adams and Thomas Jefferson , both of whom were overseas representing the country as diplomats .","0"
government," Because the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation proved impossible to overcome , the convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787 decided to create an entirely new government .","0"
government," 5883 . One of the first differences among the delegates to become clear was between those from large states , such as New York and Virginia , and those who represented small states , like Delaware .","0"
government," When discussing the structure of the government under the new constitution , the delegates from Virginia called for a bicameral legislature consisting of two houses .","1"
government," The number of a state ’s representatives in each house was to be based on the state ’s population .","0"
government," 5889 . After debating at length over whether the Virginia Plan or the New Jersey Plan provided the best model for the nation ’s legislature , the framers of the Constitution had ultimately arrived at what is called the Great Compromise , suggested by Roger Sherman of Connecticut .","0"
government," Congress , it was decided , would consist of two chambers : the Senate and the House of Representatives .","1"
government," 5892 . The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .","0"
government," They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others , thus requiring them to work together .","0"
government," 5895 . In a federal system , power is divided between the federal ( or national ) government and the state governments .","1"
government," Great or explicit powers , called enumerated powers , were granted to the federal government to declare war , impose taxes , coin and regulate currency , regulate foreign and interstate commerce , raise and maintain an army and a navy , maintain a post office , make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes , and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants .","1"
government," 5898 . On September 17 , 1787 , the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia voted to approve the document they had drafted over the course of many months .","0"
government," Some did not support it , but the majority did .","0"
government," 5901 . Other delegates , such as Edmund Randolph of Virginia , disapproved of the Constitution because it created a new federal judicial system .","0"
government," Their fear was that the federal courts would be too far away from where those who were tried lived .","0"
government," 5904 . Opponents of ratification were called Anti - Federalists .","1"
government," Anti - Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms .","0"
government," 5907 . The approval of New York was the last major hurdle .","0"
government," Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay wrote a series of essays , beginning in 1787 , arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution ( [ link ] ) .","1"
government," Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers , these eighty - five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius , a supporter of the Roman Republic .","0"
government," 5910 . Indeed , Hamilton asked rhetorically , would American citizens best be served by a representative “ whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and his acquaintances ” or by someone with more extensive knowledge of the world ?","0"
government," To those who argued that a merchant and land - owning elite would come to dominate Congress , Hamilton countered that the majority of men currently sitting in New York ’s state senate and assembly were landowners of moderate wealth and that artisans usually chose merchants , “ their natural patron [ s ] and friend [ s ] , ” to represent them .","0"
government," An aristocracy would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been chosen by lesser men .","0"
government," 5913 . For those who worried that the president might indeed grow too ambitious or king - like , Hamilton , in Federalist No. 68 , provided assurance that placing the leadership of the country in the hands of one person was not dangerous .","0"
government," 5919 . The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .","0"
government," Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .","0"
government," 5922 . For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .","1"
government," The Fifth Amendment , which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life , liberty , or property except by a legal proceeding , was also greatly influenced by English law as well as the protections granted to Virginians in the Virginia Declaration of Rights .","1"
government," 5925 . The Ninth and Tenth Amendments were intended to provide yet another assurance that people ’s rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful .","0"
government," The Ninth Amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the preceding documents .","1"
government," This was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive , and the government should not attempt to interfere with them .","0"
government," 5928 . For example , the Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators .","1"
government," The Twentieth Amendment , which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression , moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January .","1"
government," In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .","0"
government," 5931 . The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .","1"
government," The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .","1"
government," It also prohibited states from depriving their residents of life , liberty , or property without a legal proceeding .","0"
government," 5934 . Subsequent amendments further extended the suffrage .","0"
government," The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .","1"
government," The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .","1"
government," 5937 . Specifically , the federal design spelled out in the Constitution divides powers between two levels of government — the states and the federal government — and creates a mechanism for them to check and balance one another .","0"
government," As an institutional design , federalism both safeguards state interests and creates a strong union led by a capable central government .","1"
government," 5940 . The main advantage of this supermajority requirement is that no changes to the Constitution can occur unless there is broad support within Congress and among states .","0"
government," The potential drawback is that numerous national amendment initiatives — such as the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) , which aims to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex — have failed because they can not garner sufficient consent among members of Congress or , in the case of the ERA , the states .","0"
government," 5943 . Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .","0"
government," Since then , power has been gradually decentralized through a process of devolution , leading to the creation of regional governments in Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland as well as the delegation of specific responsibilities to them .","0"
government," Other democratic countries with unitary systems , such as France , Japan , and Sweden , have followed a similar path of decentralization .","0"
government," 5946 . The last clause of Article I , Section 8 , commonly referred to as the elastic clause or the necessary and proper cause , enables Congress “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying ” out its constitutional responsibilities .","1"
government," While the enumerated powers define the policy areas in which the national government has authority , the elastic clause allows it to create the legal means to fulfill those responsibilities .","0"
government," 5955 . 74 Haw . 530 .","0"
government," To address this concern , Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) in 1996 .","0"
government," The law declared that “ No state ( or other political subdivision within the United States ) need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex , even if the marriage was concluded or recognized in another state . ”","1"
government," The law also barred federal benefits for same - sex partners .","0"
government," 5958 . The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV asserts that states are prohibited from discriminating against out - of - staters by denying them such guarantees as access to courts , legal protection , property rights , and travel rights .","1"
government," The clause has not been interpreted to mean there can not be any difference in the way a state treats residents and non - residents .","0"
government," 5964 . As George Washington ’s secretary of the treasury from 1789 to 1795 , Alexander Hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank .","0"
government," For Hamilton , the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress ’s authority , and he hoped the bank would foster economic development , print and circulate paper money , and provide loans to the government .","1"
government," Although Thomas Jefferson , Washington ’s secretary of state , staunchly opposed Hamilton ’s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument , Hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation .","0"
government," The Lehrman Institute .","0"
government," 5967 . When the bank ’s charter expired in 1811 , Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal .","0"
government," However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .","0"
government," Many states rejected the Second Bank , arguing that the national government was infringing upon the states ’ constitutional jurisdiction .","0"
government," 5970 . Defining the scope of national power was the subject of another landmark Supreme Court decision in 1824 .","0"
government," In Gibbons v. Ogden , the court had to interpret the commerce clause of Article I , Section 8 ; specifically , it had to determine whether the federal government had the sole authority to regulate the licensing of steamboats operating between New York and New Jersey . Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. 1 ( 1824 ) .","1"

government," We typically envision civil liberties as being limitations on government power , intended to protect freedoms that governments may not legally intrude on .","1"
government," For example , the First Amendment denies the government the power to prohibit “ the free exercise ” of religion ; the states and the national government can not forbid people to follow a religion of their choice , even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided , blasphemous , or otherwise inappropriate .","0"

government," Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes .","0"
government," 6060 . Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .","0"
government," For example , during the Civil War , President Abraham Lincoln detained suspected Confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in Union - controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts , leading the Supreme Court to rule in Ex parte Milligan that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating .","0"

government," 6063 . 84 , argued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ”","0"
government," Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .","0"
government," Later , James Madison , in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the Bill of Rights , acknowledged another Federalist argument : “ It has been said , that a bill of rights is not necessary , because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions . ”","0"
government," American History from Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond , “ Madison Speech Proposing the Bill of Rights June 8 1789 , ” http://www.let.rug.nl / usa / documents/1786 - 1800 / madison - speech - proposing - the - bill - of - rights - june-8 - 1789.php ( March 4 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," For that matter , the Articles of Confederation had not included a specific listing of rights either .","0"
government," 6066 . Ultimately , James Madison delivered on this promise by proposing a package of amendments in the First Congress , drawing from the Declaration of Rights in the Virginia state constitution , suggestions from the ratification conventions , and other sources , which were extensively debated in both houses of Congress and ultimately proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states .","0"
government," Ten of the amendments were successfully ratified by the requisite 75 percent of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights ( [ link ] ) .","1"
government," 6069 . In the wake of the Civil War , however , the prevailing thinking about the application of the Bill of Rights to the states changed .","0"
government," Soon after slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment , state governments — particularly those in the former Confederacy — began to pass “ black codes ” that restricted the rights of former slaves and effectively relegated them to second - class citizenship under their state laws and constitutions .","1"
government," Angered by these actions , members of the Radical Republican faction in Congress demanded that the laws be overturned .","0"
government," 6075 . Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .","0"
government," In 1999 , Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a majority of the Supreme Court , argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another .","0"
government," Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 ( 1999 ) .","0"

government," McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010 ) .","0"
government," The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ”","0"
government," This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .","1"
government," Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .","0"
government," 6081 . We can broadly divide the provisions of the Bill of Rights into three categories .","0"
government," The First , Second , Third , and Fourth Amendments protect basic individual freedoms ; the Fourth ( partly ) , Fifth , Sixth , Seventh , and Eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity ; and the Ninth and Tenth , are consistent with the framers ’ view that the Bill of Rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," 6084 . At the same time , public schooling was beginning to take root on a wide scale .","0"
government," Since most states had traditional Protestant majorities and most state officials were Protestants themselves , the public school curriculum incorporated many Protestant features ; at times , these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other Christian sects or from other religious traditions .","0"
government," The establishment clause today tends to be interpreted a bit more broadly than in the past ; it not only forbids the creation of a “ Church of the United States ” or “ Church of Ohio ” it also forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion ( of any variety ) over non - religion .","0"
government," Thus , the government can not promote , say , Islamic beliefs over Sikh beliefs or belief in God over atheism or agnosticism ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," 6087 . The free exercise clause , on the other hand , limits the ability of the government to control or restrict religious practices .","1"
government," This portion of the First Amendment regulates not the government ’s promotion of religion , but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices .","0"
government," 6090 . In the 1960s and 1970s , the court decided two cases in which it laid out a general test for deciding similar cases in the future .","0"
government," In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria .","0"
government," Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .","0"
government," It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ”","1"
government," In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .","1"
government," This standard became known as the Sherbert test .","0"
government," 6093 . But because it replaced the Sherbert test with one that allowed more government regulation of religious practices , followers of other religious traditions grew concerned that state and local laws , even ones neutral on their face , might be used to curtail their religious practices .","0"
government," In 1993 , in response to this decision , Congress passed a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , which was followed in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act after part of the RFRA was struck down by the Supreme Court .","0"
government," In addition , since 1990 , twenty - one states have passed state RFRAs that include the Sherbert test in state law , and state court decisions in eleven states have enshrined the Sherbert test ’s compelling governmental interest interpretation of the free exercise clause into state law .","0"

government," Opponents of RFRA laws argued that individuals and businesses should be required , per Obergefell v. Hodges , to serve same - sex marriages on an equal basis as a matter of ensuring the civil rights of gays and lesbians , just as they would be obliged to cater or photograph an interracial marriage .","0"

government," In a 1969 case involving the Ku Klux Klan , Brandenburg v. Ohio , the Supreme Court found that only speech or writing that constituted a direct call or plan to imminent lawless action , an illegal act in the immediate future , could be suppressed ; the mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was not enough .","1"

government," Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ”","0"
government," Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .","0"

government," Traditionally , the main use of eminent domain was to obtain property for transportation corridors like railroads , highways , canals and reservoirs , and pipelines , which require fairly straight routes to be efficient .","0"
government," 6135 . Most people accused of crimes decline their right to a jury trial .","0"
government," This choice is typically the result of a plea bargain , an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant pleads guilty to the charge ( s ) in question , or perhaps to less serious charges , in exchange for more lenient punishment than he or she might receive if convicted after a full trial .","1"

government," In 1965 , the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in Griswold v. Connecticut , a case that struck down a state law forbidding even married individuals to use any form of contraception . Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) Although many subsequent cases before the Supreme Court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate , sexual conduct , the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities , movements , and communications .","1"
government," Both these senses of privacy are examined below .","0"
government," 6150 . Beyond the issues of contraception and abortion , the right to privacy has been interpreted to encompass a more general right for adults to have noncommercial , consensual sexual relationships in private .","0"
government," However , this legal development is relatively new ; as recently as 1986 , the Supreme Court ruled that states could still criminalize sex acts between two people of the same sex . Bowers v. Hardwick , 478 U.S. 186 ( 1986 ) .","1"

government," Craig v. Boren , 429 U.S. 190 ( 1976 ) ; Clark v. Jeter , 486 U.S. 456 ( 1988 ) .","0"
government," It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective . ” This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable , not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place .","1"

government," Yet , despite the seemingly clear language of the Constitution , Congress has found ways to get around this rule .","0"

government," In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .","0"
government," Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .","0"

government," 6756 . President Adams had appointed William Marbury to a position in Washington , DC , but his commission was not delivered before Adams left office .","0"
government," So Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to use its power under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and issue a writ of mandamus to force the new president ’s secretary of state , James Madison , to deliver the commission documents .","0"

government," For example , when Samantha Elauf , a Muslim woman , was denied a job working for the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company ’s dress code , the Supreme Court ruled that her First Amendment rights had been violated , making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages .","0"

government," For example , the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty , ruling that the Eighth Amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for committing a capital crime and that the government may consider “ retribution and the possibility of deterrence ” when it seeks capital punishment for a crime that so warrants it .","1"

government," Under criminal law , governments establish rules and punishments ; laws define conduct that is prohibited because it can harm others and impose punishment for committing such an act .","0"
government," Crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness ; felonies are the more serious crimes .","1"

government," The others are in Washington , DC ; Puerto Rico ; Guam ; the U.S. Virgin Islands ; and the Northern Mariana Islands .","0"
government," 6783 . Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .","0"
government," Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .","1"
government," Beginning in 1789 when there were just thirteen , the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system .","0"
government," 6786 . The U.S. court system operates on the principle of stare decisis ( Latin for stand by things decided ) , which means that today ’s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past , and tomorrow ’s rulings rely on what is decided today .","1"
government," Stare decisis is especially important in the U.S. common law system , in which the consistency of precedent ensures greater certainty and stability in law and constitutional interpretation , and it also contributes to the solidity and legitimacy of the court system itself .","0"
government," 6789 . At the federal level , the president nominates a candidate to a judgeship or justice position , and the nominee must be confirmed by a majority vote in the U.S. Senate , a function of the Senate ’s “ advice and consent ” role .","0"
government," All judges and justices in the national courts serve lifetime terms of office .","0"
government," 6795 . Since their appointments , both justices have made rulings consistent with a more liberal ideology .","0"
government," The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 has prompted the most recent discussion of appointing a new justice , with Obama nominating Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat .","0"
government," However , action on this nominee is unlikely given the election of Republican Donald Trump to the presidency .","0"

government," While a look at the Supreme Court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves , they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators , lawyers , and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system .","0"
government," 6810 . With the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 , there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court ’s more conservative wing — Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas and Alito , while four are considered more liberal - leaning — Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," Justice Kennedy has become known as the “ swing ” vote , particularly on decisions like the Court ’s same - sex marriage rulings in 2015 , because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one .","0"

government," Thus , increased diversity in state legislatures can have consequences for voter engagement and for the type of legislation pursued and passed within these bodies .","0"
government," 6897 . Under consecutive term limits , a member can serve for only a specified period of time in either the state house or the state senate , most commonly eight years .","0"
government," To try to regain a seat in the legislature once the limit has been met , the member will have to wait to run for office again .","0"
government," 6900 . Interest groups may thus enjoy greater ability to set the agenda and push for policy that favors their organization .","0"
government," This same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials .","0"
government," See note above .","0"
government," This presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature ’s ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions , such as oversight .","0"
government," 6909 . The activities by which government achieves these functions include — but are not limited to — taxation , homeland security , immigration , foreign affairs , and education .","0"
government," The more society grows and the need for government services expands , the more challenging bureaucratic management and public administration becomes .","0"
government," Public administration is both the implementation of public policy in government bureaucracies and the academic study that prepares civil servants for work in those organizations .","0"

government," 6924 . While the federal bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds during the twentieth century , it also underwent a very different evolution .","0"
government," Beginning with the Pendleton Act in the 1880s , the bureaucracy shifted away from the spoils system toward a merit system .","0"
government," The distinction between these two forms of bureaucracy is crucial .","0"
government," 6930 . The classic model of bureaucracy is typically called the ideal Weberian model , and it was developed by Max Weber , an early German sociologist .","0"
government," Weber argued that the increasing complexity of life would simultaneously increase the demands of citizens for government services .","0"
government," 6936 . Elected officials are regularly frustrated when bureaucrats seem not follow the path they intended .","0"

government," More formally , it is the relatively stable set of purposive governmental actions that address matters of concern to some part of society . James E. Anderson .","0"
government," 6957 . Forests , water , and fisheries , however , are a type of public good called common goods , which are not excludable but may be finite .","1"
government," The problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them , no one has a financial interest in protecting their long - term or future value .","0"
government," Without government regulation , a factory owner can feel free to pollute the air or water , since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else ( see [ link ] ) .","0"
government," 6960 . In 1964 , Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many .","0"
government," One policy category , known as distributive policy , tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few .","1"
government," 6963 . While distributive policy , according to Lowi , has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits , regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement , with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits .","1"
government," A relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy , but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society .","0"
government," 6966 . A final type of policy is redistributive policy , so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another .","1"
government," That is , according to Lowi , the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits , but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits .","0"
government," 6972 . After completing a minimum number of years of work , American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age .","0"
government," It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group , and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment .","1"
government," The amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on his or her lifetime earnings .","0"
government," 6975 . Medicaid is a formula - based , health insurance program , which means beneficiaries must demonstrate they fall within a particular income category .","1"
government," Individuals in the Medicaid program receive a fairly comprehensive set of health benefits , although access to health care may be limited because fewer providers accept payments from the program ( it pays them less for services than does Medicare ) .","0"
government," 6978 . A lobbying group that frequently takes on advocacy roles is AARP ( formerly the American Association of Retired Persons ) ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," AARP ’s primary job is to convince the government to provide more public resources and services to senior citizens , often through regulatory or redistributive politics .","1"
government," 6981 . The policy process contains four sequential stages : ( 1 ) agenda setting , ( 2 ) policy enactment , ( 3 ) policy implementation , and ( 4 ) evaluation .","1"
government," Given the sheer number of issues already processed by the government , called the continuing agenda , and the large number of new proposals being pushed at any one time , it is typically quite difficult to move a new policy all the way through the process .","0"
government," Agenda setting is the crucial first stage of the public policy process .","0"
government," 6987 . Roosevelt sought to implement a new approach to economic regulation known as Keynesianism .","0"
government," Named for its developer , the economist John Maynard Keynes , Keynesian economics argues that it is possible for a recession to become so deep , and last for so long , that the typical models of economic collapse and recovery may not work .","1"
government," Keynes suggested that economic growth was closely tied to the ability of individuals to consume goods .","0"
government," 6990 . Portions of the budget not devoted to mandatory spending are categorized as discretionary spending because Congress must pass legislation to authorize money to be spent each year .","0"
government," About 50 percent of the approximately $ 1.2 trillion set aside for discretionary spending each year pays for most of the operations of government , including employee salaries and the maintenance of federal buildings .","0"
government," 6993 . As you would expect , Keynesians and supply - siders disagree about which forms of tax policy are best .","0"
government," Keynesians , with their concern about whether consumers can really stimulate demand , prefer progressive taxes systems that increase the effective tax rate as the taxpayer ’s income increases .","0"
government," This policy leaves those most likely to spend their money with more money to spend .","0"
government," 6996 . Financial panics arise when too many people , worried about the solvency of their investments , try to withdraw their money at the same time .","0"
government," Such panics plagued U.S. banks until 1913 ( [ link ] ) , when Congress enacted the Federal Reserve Act .","0"
government," The act established the Federal Reserve System , also known as the Fed , as the central bank of the United States .","1"
government," 7002 . If the European continent was stable , so too was the world .","0"
government," During the Cold War era that followed World War II , stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union , and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable .","0"
government," Until approximately 1989–1990 , advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers .","0"
government," 7005 . One of the unique and challenging aspects of global affairs is the fact that no world - level authority exists to mandate when and how the world ’s nations interact .","0"
government," After the failed attempt by President Woodrow Wilson and others to formalize a “ League of Nations ” in the wake of World War I in the 1920s , and on the heels of a worldwide depression that began in 1929 , came World War II , history ’s deadliest military conflict .","0"
government," Now , in the early decades of the twenty - first century , it is common to think of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as the big game - changer .","0"
government," 7011 . The balance of trade is the relationship between a country ’s inflow and outflow of goods .","1"
government," The United States sells many goods and services around the world , but overall it maintains a trade deficit , in which more goods and services are coming in from other countries than are going out to be sold overseas .","1"
government," 7014 . At the more serious end of the foreign policy decision - making spectrum , and usually as a last resort when diplomacy fails , the U.S. military and defense establishment exists to provide the United States the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors .","0"
government," Such war can be offensive , as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .","0"
government," Or it can be defensive , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , also known as Operation Desert Storm ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," 7017 . This makes diplomacy and international coordination an ongoing bargain as issues evolve and governmental leaders and nations change .","0"
government," Foreign relations are certainly made smoother by the existence of cross - national voluntary associations like the United Nations , the Organization of American States , and the African Union .","0"
government," However , these associations do not have strict enforcement authority over specific nations , unless a group of member nations takes action in some manner ( which is ultimately voluntary ) .","0"
government," 7023 . The format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years .","0"
government," The U.S. Constitution outlines the treaty process in Article II .","0"
government," The president negotiates a treaty , the Senate consents to the treaty by a two - thirds vote , and finally the president ratifies it .","0"
government," 7026 . On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .","0"
government," In the key case of United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law .","0"
government," United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 ( 1942 ) .","0"
government," Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .","0"
government," Many in the Senate thought the Iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement .","0"
government," 7029 . Madeleine Albright ( a ) , the first female secretary of state , was nominated by President Bill Clinton and unanimously confirmed by the Senate 99 – 0 .","0"
government," Colin Powell ( b ) , nominated by George W. Bush , was also unanimously confirmed .","0"
government," 7032 . These sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president , including the deployment of troops and/or intelligence agents in a crisis , executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy , presidential use of military force , and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises .","1"
government," These measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the “ energy and dispatch ” that Alexander Hamilton , writing in the Federalist Papers , saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency .","0"
government," Emergency spending does involve Congress through its power of the purse , but Congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies .","0"
government," 7038 . Probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the Eisenhower presidency .","0"
government," When President Dwight D. Eisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the Senate as treaties , Congress reacted by considering a constitutional amendment ( the Bricker Amendment ) that would have altered the treaty process as we know it .","0"
government," Eisenhower understood the message and began to send more agreements through the process as treaties .","0"
government," Krutz and Peake .","0"
government," 7044 . First , congressional party leaders in the majority and minority parties speak on behalf of their institution and their party on all types of issues , including foreign policy .","0"
government," Some House and Senate members ask to serve on the foreign policy committees , such as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and the two defense committees ( [ link ] ) .","1"
government," These members might have military bases within their districts or states and hence have a constituency reason for being interested in foreign policy .","0"
government," 7047 . The national security advisor heads the president ’s National Security Council , a group of senior - level staff from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy advisor . Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .","1"
government," Even more important on intelligence than the CIA director is the director of national intelligence , a position created in the government reorganizations after 9/11 , who oversees the entire intelligence community in the U.S. government .","0"
government," 7056 . The end of the Cold War opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller European countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared .","0"
government," Some in the United States felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement , including a vocal senator , Jesse Helms ( R - NC ) , who was against the United States continuing to be the military “ policeman ” of the world .","0"
government," Helms was famous for opposing nearly all treaties brought to the Senate during his tenure .","0"
government," 7059 . There is an element of idealism in liberal internationalism , because the United States assumes other countries will also put their best foot forward .","0"
government," A classic example of a liberal internationalist is President Woodrow Wilson , who sought a League of Nations to voluntarily save the world after World War I .","0"
government," 7062 . Neoconservatives believe that rather than exercising restraint and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes , the United States should aggressively use its might to promote its values and ideals around the world .","0"
government," The aggressive use ( or threat ) of hard power is the core value of neoconservatism .","1"
government," Acting unilaterally is acceptable in this view , as is adopting a preemptive strategy in which the United States intervenes militarily before the enemy can make its move .","0"

Following the Declaration of Independence , each of the thirteen states had drafted and ratified a constitution providing for a republican form of government in which political power rested in the hands of the people , although the right to vote was limited to free ( white ) men , and the property requirements for voting differed among the states .","0"
government," Each state had a governor and an elected legislature .","0"
government," 5876 . The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , already recognized by many , became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers , led by Daniel Shays .","1"
government," Known as Shays ’ Rebellion , the incident panicked the governor of Massachusetts , who called upon the national government for assistance .","0"
government," 5879 . Because all thirteen states had to agree to any alteration of the Articles , the convention in Annapolis could not accomplish its goal .","0"
government," Two of the delegates , Alexander Hamilton and James Madison , requested that all states send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia the following year to attempt once again to revise the Articles of Confederation .","0"
government," All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting , a total of seventy men in all , but many did not attend .","0"
government," 5882 . Those who favored a nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it a permanent part of American society .","0"
government," The only decision that all could agree on was the election of George Washington , the former commander of the Continental Army and hero of the American Revolution , as the president of the convention .","0"
government," 5885 . Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .","0"
government," Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .","1"
government," Thus , smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states .","0"
government," 5888 . The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .","0"
government," In Article I , ten sections describe the structure of Congress , the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in Congress , the length of Congressional terms , and the powers of Congress .","0"
government," The national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation , slavery , and national power .","0"
government," 5891 . Although debates over slavery and representation in Congress occupied many at the convention , the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful .","0"
government," The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .","0"
government," They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others , thus requiring them to work together .","0"
government," 5894 . The strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain a degree of sovereignty was the framers ’ creation of a federal system of government .","0"
government," In a federal system , power is divided between the federal ( or national ) government and the state governments .","1"
government," Great or explicit powers , called enumerated powers , were granted to the federal government to declare war , impose taxes , coin and regulate currency , regulate foreign and interstate commerce , raise and maintain an army and a navy , maintain a post office , make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes , and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants .","1"
government," 5897 . Although the states retained a considerable degree of sovereignty , the supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution proclaimed that the Constitution , laws passed by Congress , and treaties made by the federal government were “ the supreme Law of the Land . ”","0"
government," In the event of a conflict between the states and the national government , the national government would triumph .","0"
government," Furthermore , although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution , Article I provided for the expansion of Congressional powers if needed .","0"
government," 5900 . But many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states .","0"
government," Virginia ’s Patrick Henry , for example , feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man .","0"
government," He also disapproved of the federal government ’s new ability to tax its citizens .","0"
government," 5903 . On the question of ratification , citizens quickly separated into two groups : Federalists and Anti - Federalists .","0"
government," The Federalists supported it .","0"
government," They tended to be among the elite members of society — wealthy and well - educated landowners , businessmen , and former military commanders who believed a strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth .","1"
government," 5906 . The Constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education , and Article VI explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office .","0"
government," This caused many , like Henry Abbot of North Carolina , to fear that government would be placed in the hands of “ pagans .","0"
government," .","0"
government," 5909 . Furthermore , tyranny could not arise in a government in which “ the legislature necessarily predominates . ”","0"
government," Finally , the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them , described as “ personal motives , ” would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority .","1"
government," According to Madison , “ Ambition must be made to counteract ambition . ”","0"
government," 5915 . In fact , presidents long followed George Washington ’s example and limited themselves to two terms .","0"
government," Only in 1951 , after Franklin Roosevelt had been elected four times , was the Twenty - Second Amendment passed to restrict the presidency to two terms .","1"
government," 5918 . Of these , only ten were accepted by three - quarters of the state legislatures .","0"
government," In 1791 , these first ten amendments were added to the Constitution and became known as the Bill of Rights .","1"
government," 5924 . The prohibition in the First Amendment against the establishment of an official church by the federal government differed significantly from both English precedent and the practice of several states that had official churches .","0"
government," The Fourth Amendment , which protects Americans from unwarranted search and seizure of their property , was also new .","1"
government," 5927 . Other amendments rectify problems that have arisen over the years or that reflect changing times .","0"
government," For example , the Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators .","1"
government," The Twentieth Amendment , which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression , moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January .","1"
government," 5930 . The Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments , ratified at the end of the Civil War , changed the lives of African Americans who had been held in slavery .","0"
government," The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .","1"
government," The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .","1"
government," 5933 . The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .","1"
government," After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .","1"
government," 5936 . The last great extension of the suffrage occurred in 1971 in the midst of the Vietnam War .","0"
government," The Twenty - Sixth Amendment reduced the voting age from twenty - one to eighteen .","1"
government," Many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in Vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them .","0"
government," 5939 . Federalism is an institutional arrangement that creates two relatively autonomous levels of government , each possessing the capacity to act directly on behalf of the people with the authority granted to it by the national constitution .","1"
government," See John Kincaid .","0"
government," 1975 .","0"
government," 5942 . Division of power can also occur via a unitary structure or confederation ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," In contrast to federalism , a unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government , where significant authority is concentrated .","1"
government," Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .","0"
government," 5945 . The Constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of U.S. federalism .","0"
government," Some delineate the scope of national and state power , while others restrict it .","0"
government," 5948 . What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .","0"
government," The Tenth Amendment affirms the states ’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”","1"
government," Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .","0"
government," 5951 . Like the federal government , the states can not violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus , passing bills of attainder , or enacting ex post facto laws .","0"
government," Furthermore , the Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868 , prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the Constitution , due process of law , or the equal protection of the laws .","1"
government," Lastly , three civil rights amendments — the Fifteenth , Nineteenth , and Twenty - Sixth — prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens ’ right to vote based on race , sex , and age .","0"
government," 5954 . The movement for marriage equality has put the full faith and credit clause to the test in recent decades .","0"
government," In light of Baehr v. Lewin , a 1993 ruling in which the Hawaii Supreme Court asserted that the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional , a number of states became worried that they would be required to recognize those marriage certificates .","1"
government," Baehr v. Lewin .","0"
government," 1993 .","0"
government," 5960 . Although the data reflect 2013 results , the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years .","0"
government," For the federal government , 47 percent of 2013 revenue came from individual income taxes and 34 percent from payroll taxes , which combine Social Security tax and Medicare tax .","0"
government," 5966 . When the bank ’s charter expired in 1811 , Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal .","0"
government," However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .","0"
government," 5969 . The Supreme Court also sided with the federal government on the issue of whether states could tax federal property .","0"
government," Under the supremacy clause of Article VI , legitimate national laws trump conflicting state laws .","1"
government," As the court observed , “ the government of the Union , though limited in its powers , is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws , when made in pursuance of the constitution , form the supreme law of the land . ” Maryland ’s action violated national supremacy because “ the power to tax is the power to destroy . ”","0"
government," This second ruling established the principle of national supremacy , which prohibits states from meddling in the lawful activities of the national government .","1"
government," 5972 . First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .","1"
government," Second , because the federal Licensing Act of 1793 , which regulated coastal commerce , was a constitutional exercise of Congress ’s authority under the commerce clause , federal law trumped the New York State license - monopoly law that had granted Ogden an exclusive steamboat operating license .","1"
government," As Marshall pointed out , “ the acts of New York must yield to the law of Congress . ”Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. 1 ( 1824 ) .","0"
government," 5975 . A nullification crisis emerged in the 1830s over President Andrew Jackson ’s tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 .","0"
government," Led by John Calhoun , President Jackson ’s vice president , nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South .","0"
government," South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .","0"
government," 5981 . Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .","1"
government," But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .","0"
government," What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .","1"
government," The defeat of the South had a huge impact on the balance of power between the states and the national government in two important ways .","0"
government," 5984 . The late 1870s ushered in a new phase in the evolution of U.S. federalism .","0"
government," Under dual federalism , the states and national government exercise exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction .","1"
government," Like the layers of a cake , the levels of government do not blend with one another but rather are clearly defined .","0"
government," 5990 . The Great Depression of the 1930s brought economic hardships the nation had never witnessed before ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," Between 1929 and 1933 , the national unemployment rate reached 25 percent , industrial output dropped by half , stock market assets lost more than half their value , thousands of banks went out of business , and the gross domestic product shrunk by one - quarter . Nicholas Crafts and Peter Fearon .","0"
government," 5993 . The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .","0"
government," The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .","0"
government," The court ’s obstructionist position infuriated Roosevelt , leading him in 1937 to propose a court - packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy , thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments .","0"
government," 5996 . The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .","0"
government," Before the Great Depression , the government offered little in terms of financial aid , social benefits , and economic rights .","0"
government," After the New Deal , it provided old - age pensions ( Social Security ) , unemployment insurance , agricultural subsidies , protections for organizing in the workplace , and a variety of other public services created during Roosevelt ’s administration .","1"
government," 6002 . Nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras , most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded .","0"
government," The Social Security Act of 1935 , which created federal subsidies for state - administered programs for the elderly ; people with handicaps ; dependent mothers ; and children , gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels .","1"
government," The unemployment insurance program , also created by the Social Security Act , requires states to provide jobless benefits , but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits .","1"
government," 6005 . New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .","1"
government," During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .","0"
government," The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “ devolution revolution ” in U.S. federalism , in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution .","0"
government," 6008 . However , many would say that the years since the 9/11 attacks have swung the pendulum back in the direction of central federal power .","0"
government," The creation of the Department of Homeland Security federalized disaster response power in Washington , and the Transportation Security Administration was created to federalize airport security .","1"
government," Broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the Faith - Based Initiative and No Child Left Behind ( during the George W. Bush administration ) and the Affordable Care Act ( during Barack Obama ’s administration ) .","0"
government," 6011 . The national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the Articles of Confederation when it provided states with land grants .","0"
government," In the first half of the 1800s , land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states .","0"
government," 6014 . Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .","1"
government," Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .","1"
government," Finally , recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants .","0"
government," 6017 . However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .","0"
government," The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .","0"
government," Under the AFDC , the federal government had reimbursed states a portion of the costs they bore for running the program without placing a ceiling on the amount .","0"
government," 6020 . For example , Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination .","1"
government," Finally , some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations , whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments .","1"
government," 6023 . A new piece of legislation aims to take this approach further .","0"
government," The 2015 Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act , HR 50 , passed the House early in 2015 before being referred to the Senate , where it waits committee consideration . U.S .","0"
government," Congress .","0"
government," 6026 . The Clery Act of 1990 , formally the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act , requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime .","1"
government," The Act is named after Jeanne Clery , who in 1986 was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her Lehigh University dorm room .","1"

government," The federal government filed suit to block the Arizona law , contending that it conflicted with federal immigration laws .","0"
government," Arizona ’s law has also divided society , because some groups , like the Tea Party movement , have supported its tough stance against illegal immigrants , while other groups have opposed it for humanitarian and human - rights reasons ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," According to a poll of Latino voters in the state by Arizona State University researchers , 81 percent opposed this bill . Daniel González .","0"
government," 6032 . The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .","0"
government," However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling .","0"
government," Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .","0"
government," All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .","0"
government," That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “ establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization , ” enumerated in the Constitution .","0"
government," 6035 . Edith Windsor , the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor , has become an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the DOMA provision that denied married same - sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections .","1"
government," In 2007 , after having lived together since the late 1960s , Windsor and her partner Thea Spyer were married in Canada , where same - sex marriage was legal .","0"

government," In the final analysis , same - sex marriage is a protected constitutional right as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court , which took up the issue again when it heard Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 .","1"
government," 6041 . Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) was established in 1980 by a woman whose thirteen - year - old daughter had been killed by a drunk driver .","0"
government," The organization lobbied state legislators to raise the drinking age and impose tougher penalties , but without success .","1"
government," 6044 . The strategy anti - abortion advocates have used in recent years is another example of venue shopping .","0"
government," In their attempts to limit abortion rights in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision making abortion legal nationwide , anti - abortion advocates initially targeted Congress in hopes of obtaining restrictive legislation .","1"
government," Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .","0"
government," Lack of progress at the national level prompted them to shift their focus to state legislators , where their advocacy efforts have been more successful .","0"
government," By 2015 , for example , thirty - eight states required some form of parental involvement in a minor ’s decision to have an abortion , forty - six states allowed individual health - care providers to refuse to participate in abortions , and thirty - two states prohibited the use of public funds to carry out an abortion except when the woman ’s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .","0"
government," 6047 . Federalism also comes with drawbacks .","0"
government," Chief among them are economic disparities across states , race - to - the - bottom dynamics ( i.e. , states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations ) , and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance .","1"
government," 6050 . Protests have erupted nationwide in response to the deaths of African Americans during interactions with police .","0"
government," Many people were deeply troubled by the revelations of Edward Snowden ( [ link ] ) that U.S. government agencies are conducting widespread surveillance , capturing not only the conversations of foreign leaders and suspected terrorists but also the private communications of U.S. citizens , even those not suspected of criminal activity .","0"
government," 6053 . The idea that Americans — indeed , people in general — have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence .","0"
government," In writing the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , Thomas Jefferson drew on the ideas of John Locke to express the colonists ’ belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects .","0"
government," It was a scathing legal indictment of King George III for violating the colonists ’ liberties .","0"
government," 6056 . Indeed , the Federalists did include in the Constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens , based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both British kings and parliaments as well as royal governors .","0"
government," In Article I , Section 9 , the Constitution limits the power of Congress in three ways : prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder , prohibiting ex post facto laws , and limiting the ability of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus .","0"
government," 6059 . Finally , the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common - law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained .","1"
government," Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .","0"
government," 6062 . The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .","0"
government," Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No . 84 , argued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ”","0"
government," Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .","0"
government," 6065 . The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .","0"
government," One of the Anti - Federalists , Brutus , whom most scholars believe to be Robert Yates , wrote : “ The powers , rights , and authority , granted to the general government by this Constitution , are as complete , with respect to every object to which they extend , as that of any state government — It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness — Life , liberty , and property , are under its controul [ sic ] .","0"
government," There is the same reason , therefore , that the exercise of power , in this case , should be restrained within proper limits , as in that of the state governments .","0"
government," ”Constitution Society , “ To the Citizens of the State of New - York , ” http://www.constitution.org/afp/brutus02.htm ( March 4 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti - Federalists may have been correct in this regard ; while the states retain a great deal of importance , the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves . The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process .","0"
government," 6068 . In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .","0"
government," In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .","1"
government," Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”","0"
government," 6071 . Representative John Bingham ( R - OH ) ( a ) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment , adopted on July 9 , 1868 .","0"
government," Influenced by his mentor , Salmon P. Chase , Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause ; after Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln ( b ) , Bingham became one of the president ’s most ardent supporters .","0"
government," 6074 . ( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .","0"
government," Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .","0"
government," In 1999 , Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a majority of the Supreme Court , argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another . Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 ( 1999 ) .","1"
government," More recently , Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause . McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010).The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ”","1"
government," This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .","1"
government," 6077 . Beginning in 1897 , the Supreme Court has found that various provisions of the Bill of Rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states , even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the Bill of Rights does — or at all .","0"
government," This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states ; in other words , the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions , even though it does n’t do so explicitly .","0"
government," When cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures , the Supreme Court decides whether state laws violate the Bill of Rights and are therefore unconstitutional .","0"
government," 6080 . Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .","0"
government," In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) , the Court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases .","1"
government," Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .","0"
government," 6083 . The first of these two freedoms is known as the establishment clause .","0"
government," Congress is prohibited from creating or promoting a state - sponsored religion ( this now includes the states too ) .","1"
government," 6086 . But some laws that may appear to establish certain religious practices are allowed .","0"
government," For example , the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday , the Christian day of rest , because by allowing people to practice their ( Christian ) faith , such rules may help ensure the “ health , safety , recreation , and general well - being ” of citizens .","1"
government," They have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on Sunday for similar reasons .","0"

government," The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores ; its founder , David Green , is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception .","0"
government," Consistent with these beliefs , he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) requiring employer - backed insurance plans to include no - charge access to the morning - after pill , a form of emergency contraception , arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience .","1"
government," Based in part on the federal RFRA , the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby ’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business ’ owners , because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby ’s employees ( e.g. , paying for them directly ) .","0"
government," 6098 . Americans who vocally supported the communist cause or opposed the war often found themselves in jail .","0"
government," In Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled that people encouraging young men to dodge the draft could be imprisoned for doing so , arguing that recommending that people disobey the law was tantamount to “ falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic ” and thus presented a “ clear and present danger ” to public order . Schenck v. United States , 249 U.S. 47 ( 1919 ) .","1"

Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .","1"
government," This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers .

government," In the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case , the Supreme Court decided that public figures needed to demonstrate not only that a negative press statement about them was untrue but also that the statement was published or made with either malicious intent or “ reckless disregard ” for the truth . New York Times v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964 ) .","1"

government," Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .","0"
government," In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . ”","1"
government," Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .","0"
government," However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .","0"
government," In particular , the concept of “ contemporary community standards ” raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place ; many people in New York or San Francisco might not bat an eye at something people in Memphis or Salt Lake City would consider offensive .","0"

government," Two years later , in McDonald v. Chicago , the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision ( 5 – 4 ) and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states , meaning that state regulation of firearms might , in some circumstances , be unconstitutional .","1"

government," The prominence of these protections in the Bill of Rights may seem surprising .","0"
government," 6128 . The most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government ( federal or state ) as the first ; the federal government can try you for violating federal law , even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action .","0"
government," For example , in the early 1990s , several Los Angeles police officers accused of brutally beating motorist Rodney King during his arrest were acquitted of various charges in a state court , but some were later convicted in a federal court of violating King ’s civil rights .","0"

government," The takings clause says that “ private property [ can not ] be taken for public use , without just compensation . ”","0"
government," This provision , along with the due process clause ’s provisions limiting the taking of property , can be viewed as a protection of individuals ’ economic liberty : their right to obtain , use , and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit .","0"
government," For example , you have the right to trade your knowledge , skills , and labor for money through work or the use of your property , or trade money or goods for other things of value , such as clothing , housing , education , or food .","0"

government," 6140 . At the same time , however , it appears that the public mood may have shifted somewhat against the death penalty , perhaps due in part to an overall decline in violent crime .","0"

government," Perhaps as a result of this and other cases , seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007 .","0"
government," As of 2015 , nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases , and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death .","0"

government," It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .","0"
government," 6143 . We saw above that James Madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed a few in the Constitution and omitted others .","0"
government," To ensure that those interpreting the Constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the Bill of Rights was not exhaustive , the Ninth Amendment states :","0"
government," 6146 . Although the term privacy does not appear in the Constitution or Bill of Rights , scholars have interpreted several Bill of Rights provisions as an indication that James Madison and Congress sought to protect a common - law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century : a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life , particularly within the bounds of the home .","1"
government," For example , we could perhaps see the Second Amendment as standing for the common - law right to self - defense in the home ; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone ’s home ; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone ’s home ; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government ’s taking a home or property ( reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment ) .","0"
government," 6149 . Starting in the 1980s , Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents began to roll back the Roe decision .","0"
government," A key turning point was the court ’s ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 , in which a plurality of the court rejected Roe ’s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test , which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not “ substantial obstacle[s ] ” ( undue burdens ) to women seeking an abortion .","1"
government," Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 ( 1992 ) .","0"
government," Thus , the court upheld some state restrictions , including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion , parental consent ( or , if not possible for some reason such as incest , authorization of a judge ) for minors , and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion .","0"
government," Other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden .","0"

In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .","0"
government," Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .","0"
government," Most European countries , at least on paper , have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance , perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes .","0"
government," 6155 . Unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise , the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed .","0"
government," In these cases , the courts are applying the rational basis test .","0"
government," That is , as long as there ’s a reason for treating some people differently that is “ rationally related to a legitimate government interest , ” the discriminatory act or law or policy is acceptable .","1"
government," Cornell University Law School : Legal Information Institute .","0"
government," 6158 . Discrimination against members of racial , ethnic , or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts , which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases .","0"
government," Under strict scrutiny , the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group — the law or action can be “ narrowly tailored ” to achieve the goal in question , and that it is the “ least restrictive means ” available to achieve that goal .","0"

To override the southern states ’ actions , lawmakers in Congress proposed two amendments to the Constitution designed to give political equality and power to former slaves ; once passed by Congress and ratified by the necessary number of states , these became the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .","0"
government," The Fourteenth Amendment , in addition to including the equal protection clause as noted above , also was designed to ensure that the states would respect the civil liberties of freed slaves .","0"

government," 6467 . Why do we have two parties ?","0"
government," The two - party system came into being because the structure of U.S. elections , with one seat tied to a geographic district , tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties .","0"
government," Even when there are other options on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office .","0"
government," 6470 . Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .","1"
government," For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .","0"
government," In 1860 , four candidates competed for the presidency : Lincoln , a Republican ; two Democrats , one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing ; and a member of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party , a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery .","0"
government," 6473 . Abandoning plurality voting , even if the winner - take - all election were kept , would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose .","0"
government," The easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme , in which a candidate wins only if he or she enjoys the support of a majority of voters .","1"
government," If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting , a run - off election is held among the top contenders .","0"
government," 6476 . Scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the U.S. system that are likely to influence party outcomes : the Electoral College , demobilized ethnicity , and campaign and election laws .","0"
government," First , the United States has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the Electoral College .","0"
government," 6479 . One of the best - known party realignments occurred when Democrats moved to include African Americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the Great Depression .","0"
government," After the Civil War , Republicans , the party of Lincoln , were viewed as the party that had freed the slaves .","0"
government," 6482 . Roosevelt won the election with almost 58 percent of the popular vote and 472 Electoral College votes , compared to incumbent Herbert Hoover ’s 59 .","0"
government," The 1932 election is considered an example of a critical election , one that represents a sudden , clear , and long - term shift in voter allegiances .","1"
government," After this election , the political parties were largely identified as being divided by differences in their members ’ socio - economic status .","0"
government," 6485 . They are part of what is known as the party organization .","0"
government," The party organization is the formal structure of the political party , and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates .","1"
government," It is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party “ brand . ” It also plays a key role in helping select , and elect , candidates for public office .","0"
government," 6488 . First , many Americans , especially young people , are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level .","0"
government," According to John Green of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics , “ Local elections tend to be about things like sewers , and roads and police protection — which are not as dramatic an issue as same - sex marriage or global warming or international affairs . ”","0"

government," Presidential elections and the behavior of the U.S. Congress are also far more likely to make the news broadcasts than the activities of county commissioners , and the national - level party organization is mostly responsible for coordinating the activities of participants at this level .","0"
government," The national party is a fundraising army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to coordinate and direct the efforts of the House and Senate .","0"
government," 6491 . One of the first challenges facing the party - in - government , or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office , is to achieve their policy goals .","1"
government," The means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties ; Republican meetings are called party conferences and Democrat meetings are called party caucuses .","1"
government," 6494 . Key benefits like committee appointments , leadership positions , and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party .","0"
government," These pressures are particularly acute for the majority party , so named because it controls more than half the seats in one of the two chambers .","1"
government," The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote .","0"
government," 6497 . For the first few decades of the current pattern of divided government , the threat it posed to the government appears to have been muted by a high degree of bipartisanship , or cooperation through compromise .","1"
government," Many pieces of legislation were passed in the 1960s and 1970s with reasonably high levels of support from both parties .","0"
government," 6500 . Movements on the left have also arisen .","0"
government," The Occupy Wall Street movement was born of the government ’s response to the Great Recession of 2008 and its assistance to endangered financial institutions , provided through the Troubled Asset Relief Program , TARP ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," The Occupy Movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to properly regulate the banking industry .","0"
government," 6503 . Several conflicting theories have been offered .","0"
government," The first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long sorting of the voting public , or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position .","0"
government," Morris Fiorina , “ Americans Have Not Become More Politically Polarized , ” The Washington Post , 23 June 2014 .","0"
government," According to the sorting thesis , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns .","0"
government," Since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics .","0"
government," 6506 . Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .","1"
government," This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .","0"
government," 6509 . According to political scientist Nolan McCarty , there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone .","0"
government," First , he argues , the Senate has become polarized just as the House of Representatives has , but people vote for Senators on a statewide basis .","0"
government," 6512 . In Federalist No. 10 , written in the late eighteenth century , James Madison noted that the formation of self - interested groups , which he called factions , was inevitable in any society , as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government .","1"
government," Interest groups and political parties are two of the most easily identified forms of factions in the United States .","0"
government," 6518 . However , members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views , but also in winning other elections .","0"
government," Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged .","0"
government," The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 .","0"
government," 6521 . Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .","0"
government," However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment .","0"
government," The Twelfth Amendment limited the House ’s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes .","0"
government," 6524 . New York : Oxford University Press , 330 - 34 .","0"
government," Many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends .","0"
government," These men were the leaders of political machines , organizations that secured votes for the party ’s candidates or supported the party in other ways .","1"
government," Perhaps more importantly , this election - focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed .","0"
government," Sean Wilentz .","0"
government," 6527 . Roosevelt attempted to form a third party , known as the Progressive Party , as an alternative to the more business - minded Republicans .","0"

government," Washington , DC : CQ Press , 105 – 131 .","0"
government," First , interest groups may take the form of membership organizations , which individuals join voluntarily and to which they usually pay dues .","1"
government," Membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns , or who want to be with others who share their views .","0"
government," 6539 . Interest groups also include associations , which are typically groups of institutions that join with others , often within the same trade or industry ( trade associations ) , and have similar concerns .","0"
government," The American Beverage Associationhttp://www.ameribev.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) . includes Coca - Cola , Red Bull North America , ROCKSTAR , and Kraft Foods .","0"
government," 6542 . While influencing policy is the primary goal , interest groups also monitor government activity , serve as a means of political participation for members , and provide information to the public and to lawmakers .","0"
government," According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , by November 2015 , thirty - six states had laws requiring that voters provide identification at the polls .","0"
government," http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx ( November 78 , 2015 ) .","0"
government," A civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) will keep track of proposed voter - identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights .","0"
government," This organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) .","0"
government," 6545 . On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .","0"
government," Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .","1"
government," These goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement .","0"
government," 6548 . Group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems .","0"
government," For instance , political scientist Robert Salisbury suggests that group leaders will offer incentives to induce activity among individuals .","0"

government," Some offer material incentives , which are tangible benefits of joining a group .","1"
government," AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .","0"
government," 6554 . Rather than being a single disturbance , debate about immigration policy has ebbed and flowed in recent years , creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances .","0"
government," When , during his presidential candidacy , Donald Trump made controversial statements about immigrants , many rallied both for and against him .","0"

government," Some argue that the United States is a nation of immigrants , whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration .","0"
government," 6557 . Joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement , which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community .","0"
government," Some interest groups develop as grassroots movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level .","1"
government," Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .","0"
government," 6560 . On the other hand , stem cell research is highly salient to members of the American Neurological Association , an interest organization that represents academic neurologists and neuroscientists .","0"
government," Accordingly , different interests represent the more specialized needs of different specialties within the medical community , but fragmentation can occur when a large interest like this has diverging needs .","0"
government," Such was also the case when several unions split from the AFL - CIO ( American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations ) , the nation ’s largest federation of unions , in 2005 .","0"

government," The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .","1"
government," The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state .","0"

government," When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .","0"
government," 6596 . But presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning , typically at the expense of the Congress .","0"
government," By the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president , it is during wartime that the chief executive is most powerful and Congress least powerful .","0"
government," For example , President Abraham Lincoln , who oversaw the prosecution of the Civil War , stretched the bounds of his legal authority in a number of ways , such as by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states .","0"

government," This position is called the Speaker of the House and is the only House officer mentioned in the Constitution .","0"
government," The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a member of the House , although to date , all fifty - four Speakers have been .","0"
government," 6611 . However , the majority rules the day in the House , like a cartel .","0"
government," On the majority side , because it holds the speakership , the majority leader also has considerable power .","0"
government," Historically , moreover , the majority leader tends to be in the best position to assume the speakership when the current Speaker steps down .","0"

government," The core committees are called standing committees .","1"
government," There are twenty standing committees in the House and sixteen in the Senate ( [ link ] ) .","0"

government," This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .","0"
government," Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .","0"

government," The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .","0"
government," Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .","0"
government," He proposed that Congress select the executive , whose powers and authority , and even length of term of service , were left largely undefined .","0"

government," It ’s hard to imagine that the 2000 presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was , but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in Article II of the Constitution , that was a real possibility .","0"
government," 6659 . An important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the Constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive — impeachment .","0"
government," Impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing ; the Constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors .","1"
government," 6662 . The most recent impeachment was of President Bill Clinton , brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky .","0"
government," House Republicans felt the affair and Clinton ’s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment .","0"
government," 6665 . Later presidents built on the foundation of these powers .","0"

government," Presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege , the right to withhold information from Congress , the judiciary , or the public .","1"
government," This right , not enumerated in the Constitution , was first asserted by George Washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch . Mark J. Rozel .","0"
government," 6680 . Reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized , amended , and approved by Congress .","0"
government," However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .","0"
government," His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .","0"
government," 6683 . Following the first election of Washington , the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process , creating separate nomination and general election stages .","0"
government," Early on , the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus .","0"
government," The caucus or large - scale gathering was made up of legislators in the Congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties .","1"
government," 6686 . The rise of the primary system during the Progressive Era came at the cost of party regulars ’ control of the process of candidate selection .","0"
government," Some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote .","0"

government," In 1796 , political rivals John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected president and vice president , respectively .","0"
government," Yet the two men failed to work well together during Adams ’s administration , much of which Jefferson spent at his Virginia residence at Monticello .","0"

government," Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .","0"
government," 6704 . But presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a Senate that ’s inclined to obstruct .","0"
government," Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made 139 and 171 recess appointments , respectively .","0"
government," President Obama has made far fewer recess appointments ; as of May 1 , 2015 , he had made only thirty - two .","0"

government," One reason this number is so low is another loophole the Senate began using at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency , the pro forma session .","0"
government," 6707 . Vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration , often with a sharp edge .","0"
government," Richard Nixon ’s vice president Spiro Agnew is an example .","0"
government," But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .","0"
government," 6710 . In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .","0"
government," Barack Obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two - term vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , was picked for his experience , especially in foreign policy .","0"
government," President Obama relied on Vice President Biden for advice throughout his tenure .","0"

government," Her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors , although in the early 1960s , Jacqueline Kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the White House along historical lines , and Lady Bird Johnson in the mid- and late 1960s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the United States .","0"
government," She also established the foundations of what came to be known as the Office of the First Lady , complete with a news reporter , Liz Carpenter , as her press secretary .","0"
government," 6722 . She shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy .","0"

government," Her successors , Laura Bush in the first decade of the twenty - first century and Michelle Obama in the second , returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies : Laura Bush advocated literacy and education , while Michelle Obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise .","0"
government," Nevertheless , the public and political profiles of first ladies remain high , and in the future , the president ’s spouse will have the opportunity to use that unelected position to advance policies that might well be less controversial and more appealing than those pushed by the president .","0"
government," 6728 . The president may not be able to appoint key members of his or her administration without Senate confirmation , but he or she can demand the resignation or removal of cabinet officers , high - ranking appointees ( such as ambassadors ) , and members of the presidential staff .","0"
government," During Reconstruction , Congress tried to curtail the president ’s removal power with the Tenure of Office Act ( 1867 ) , which required Senate concurrence to remove presidential nominees who took office upon Senate confirmation .","0"
government," Andrew Johnson ’s violation of that legislation provided the grounds for his impeachment in 1868 .","0"

Many of the most famous executive orders have come in times of war or invoke the president ’s authority as commander - in - chief , including Franklin Roosevelt ’s order permitting the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942 and Harry Truman ’s directive desegregating the armed forces ( 1948 ) .","0"
government," The most famous presidential proclamation was Abraham Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation ( 1863 ) , which declared slaves in areas under Confederate control to be free ( with a few exceptions ) .","1"
government," 6734 . Finally , presidents have also used the line - item veto and signing statements to alter or influence the application of the laws they sign .","0"
government," A line - item veto is a type of veto that keeps the majority of a spending bill unaltered but nullifies certain lines of spending within it .","1"
government," While a number of states allow their governors the line - item veto ( discussed in the chapter on state and local government ) , the president acquired this power only in 1996 after Congress passed a law permitting it .","0"
government," 6737 . But the advent of civil service reform in the 1880s systematically deprived presidents of that option and reduced its scope and effectiveness .","0"
government," Although the president may call upon various agencies for assistance in lobbying for proposals , such as the Office of Legislative Liaison with Congress , it is often left to the chief executive to offer incentives and rewards .","0"
government," Some of these are symbolic , like private meetings in the White House or an appearance on the campaign trail .","0"
government," 6740 . Nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful : Lyndon Johnson ’s Vietnam and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong , leaving behind legacies that include terms like Vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix “ -gate ” to scandals and controversies .","0"
government," The youth and glamour that John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline brought to the White House in the early 1960s ( a ) helped give rise to the legend of “ one brief shining moment that was Camelot ” after Kennedy ’s presidency was cut short by his assassination on November 22 , 1963 .","0"
government," Despite a tainted legacy , President Richard Nixon gives his trademark “ V for Victory ” sign as he leaves the White House on August 9 , 1974 ( b ) , after resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal .","0"
government," 6743 . It distinguishes which are matters of original jurisdiction and which are for appellate jurisdiction .","0"
government," Under original jurisdiction , a case is heard for the first time , whereas under appellate jurisdiction , a court hears a case on appeal from a lower court and may change the lower court ’s decision .","1"
government," The Constitution also limits the Supreme Court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states , or between the United States and foreign ambassadors or ministers .","0"
government," 6746 . The first session of the first U.S. Congress laid the framework for today ’s federal judicial system , established in the Judiciary Act of 1789 .","0"
government," Although legislative changes over the years have altered it , the basic structure of the judicial branch remains as it was set early on : At the lowest level are the district courts , where federal cases are tried , witnesses testify , and evidence and arguments are presented .","0"
government," 6749 . But it took years for the Court to get to that point , and it faced a number of setbacks on the way to such recognition .","0"
government," In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit .","0"
government," Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. 419 ( 1793 ) .","0"
government," However , their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment , passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795 .","0"
government," In protecting the states , the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating , “ The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State . ”","0"
government," It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it .","0"

government," 6755 . The Supreme Court found itself in the middle of a dispute between the outgoing presidential administration of John Adams and that of incoming president ( and opposition party member ) Thomas Jefferson .","0"
government," It was an interesting circumstance at the time , particularly because Jefferson and the man who would decide the case — John Marshall — were themselves political rivals .","0"
government," 6761 . With each ACA case it has decided , the Supreme Court has served as the umpire , upholding the law and some of its provisions on one hand , but ruling some aspects of it unconstitutional on the other .","0"
government," Both supporters and opponents of the law have claimed victory and faced defeat .","0"
government," 6764 . Societal traditions , public opinion , and politics have often stood in the way of the full expansion of rights and liberties to different groups , and not everyone has agreed that these rights should be expanded as they have been by the courts .","0"

government," 6773 . State courts really are the core of the U.S. judicial system , and they are responsible for a huge area of law .","0"
government," Most crimes and criminal activity , such as robbery , rape , and murder , are violations of state laws , and cases are thus heard by state courts .","0"
government," State courts also handle civil matters ; personal injury , malpractice , divorce , family , juvenile , probate , and contract disputes and real estate cases , to name just a few , are usually state - level cases .","0"
government," 6776 . From an individual ’s perspective , the dual court system has both benefits and drawbacks .","0"
government," On the plus side , each person has more than just one court system ready to protect his or her rights .","0"
government," 6782 . Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .","0"
government," Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .","0"
government," 6788 . Certainly , court interpretations can change as times and circumstances change — and as the courts themselves change when new judges are selected and take their place on the bench .","0"
government," For example , the membership of the Supreme Court had changed entirely between Plessey v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) , which brought the doctrine of “ separate but equal ” and Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) , which required integration .","0"

government," Today this structure of power sharing is referred to as federalism .","0"
government," 6848 . In addition to these expressed powers , the national government was given implied powers that , while not clearly stated , are inferred .","1"
government," These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ”","0"

government," First , social welfare policy is designed to ensure some level of equity in a democratic political system based on competitive , free - market economics .","1"
government," During the Great Depression , many politicians came to fear that the high unemployment and low - income levels plaguing society could threaten the stability of democracy , as was happening in European countries like Germany and Italy .","0"
government," 6971 . Social Security addresses these concerns with three important tools .","0"
government," First and best known is the retirement benefit .","0"
government," 6974 . While Social Security was designed to provide cash payments to sustain the aged and disabled , Medicare and Medicaid were intended to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to health care .","0"
government," Medicare , like Social Security , is an entitlement program funded through payroll taxes .","0"

The desire of Keynesians to create a minimal level of aggregate demand , coupled with a Depression - era preference to promote social welfare policy , led the president and Congress to develop a federal budget with spending divided into two broad categories : mandatory and discretionary ( see [ link ] ) .","0"

government," This theory originated with University of California – Berkeley professor Aaron Wildavsky and suggests that there are two distinct presidencies , one for foreign policy and one for domestic policy , and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy .","0"
government," Let ’s look at the reasoning behind this thesis .","0"
government," 7043 . While the president still has stronger foreign policy powers than domestic powers , the governing context has changed in two key ways .","0"
government," First , the Cold War ended in 1989 with the demolition of the Berlin Wall , the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union , and the eventual opening up of Eastern European territories to independence and democracy .","0"

government," Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity for the nation , secure national borders , and the safety and well - being of citizens .","0"
government," 5818 . The government of the United States can best be described as a republic , or representative democracy .","0"
government," A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people . In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .","1"
government," 5821 . However , in representative governments like the United States , minority rights are protected : people can not be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be .","0"
government," For example , let ’s say American society decided that atheists , people who do not believe that God exists , were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country .","0"

government," 5833 . The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .","1"
government," Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .","1"
government," At the same time , neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone ’s right to free expression to interfere with someone else ’s ability to exercise his or her own rights .","0"

government," Common Cause has also advocated that the Electoral College be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote .","0"
government," 5842 . Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today .","0"
government," Likewise , the sit - ins ( and sleep - ins and pray - ins ) staged by African American civil rights activists , which they employed successfully to desegregate lunch counters , motels , and churches , have been adopted today by movements such as Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street ( [ link ] ) .","0"

government," Unfortunately , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues , capture only people ’s latent preferences or beliefs .","0"
government," Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time .","0"
government," 5851 . Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government , the most important is surely John Locke ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," The most significant contributions of Locke , a seventeenth - century English philosopher , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be God - given rights to life , liberty , and property .","0"
government," 5854 . People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government ’s protection of their lives , liberty , and property .","1"
government," Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract .","0"
government," Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it , the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms .","0"
government," 5857 . All this began to change in 1763 when the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France came to an end , and Great Britain gained control of most of the French territory in North America .","0"
government," The colonists had fought on behalf of Britain , and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been taken from France .","0"
government," 5860 . The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act , passed in 1765 , which required that almost all paper goods , such as diplomas , land deeds , contracts , and newspapers , have revenue stamps placed on them .","0"
government," The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .","1"

government," In it , Jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion .","0"
government," 5872 . Many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and overbearing .","0"
government," Thus , a confederation was created — an entity in which independent , self - governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense .","1"
government," Fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another , however , the framers of the Articles of Confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government .","0"
government," 5875 . One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes .","0"
government," To avoid any perception of “ taxation without representation , ” the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes .","0"
government," 5878 . In 1786 , Virginia and Maryland invited delegates from the other eleven states to meet in Annapolis , Maryland , for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation .","0"
government," However , only five states sent representatives .","0"
government," 5881 . Fifty - five delegates arrived in Philadelphia in May 1787 for the meeting that became known as the Constitutional Convention .","0"
government," Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful .","0"
government," 5884 . Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .","0"
government," Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .","1"
government," 5887 . The Constitution consists of a preamble and seven articles .","0"
government," The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .","0"
government," 5890 . The Three - Fifths Compromise , illustrated in [ link ] , resolved the impasse , although not in a manner that truly satisfied anyone .","0"
government," For purposes of Congressional apportionment , slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population , including free African Americans and 60 percent ( three - fifths ) of their enslaved population .","0"
government," 5893 . Neither of these branches had existed under the Articles of Confederation .","0"
government," Thus , Congress can pass laws , but its power to do so can be checked by the president , who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become a law .","0"
government," Later , in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison , the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws , a process called judicial review .","1"
government," 5896 . All powers not expressly given to the national government , however , were intended to be exercised by the states .","1"
government," These powers are known as reserved powers ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," Thus , states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce ( commerce within the borders of a state ) and marriage .","0"
government," 5899 . This approach to ratification was an unusual one .","0"
government," Since the authority inherent in the Articles of Confederation and the Confederation Congress had rested on the consent of the states , changes to the nation ’s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures .","0"
government," 5902 . John Adams and Thomas Jefferson carried on a lively correspondence regarding the ratification of the Constitution .","0"
government," In the following excerpt ( reproduced as written ) from a letter dated March 15 , 1789 , after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen , Jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens ’ freedoms was necessary and should be added to the Constitution :","0"
government," 5905 . Anti - Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms .","0"
government," Although some Anti - Federalists , like Patrick Henry , were wealthy , most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of “ the middling sort . ”","0"
government," This was certainly the fear of Melancton Smith , a New York merchant and landowner , who believed that power should rest in the hands of small , landowning farmers of average wealth who “ are more temperate , of better morals and less ambitious than the great . ”","0"

government," 5908 . Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay wrote a series of essays , beginning in 1787 , arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers , these eighty - five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius , a supporter of the Roman Republic .","0"
government," 5911 . An aristocracy would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been chosen by lesser men .","0"
government," Similarly , Jay reminded New Yorkers in Federalist No .","0"
government," 2 that union had been the goal of Americans since the time of the Revolution .","0"
government," 5914 . Because these men would be members of a “ transient ” body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state , they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the “ heats and ferments ” of the voters .","0"
government," Indeed , Hamilton argued in Federalist No . 70 , instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant , Americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many .","0"
government," 5917 . Responding to charges by Anti - Federalists that the Constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals , the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for American citizens .","0"
government," James Madison , a member of Congress from Virginia , took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the Constitution .","0"
government," 5920 . The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .","1"
government," Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .","0"
government," For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .","0"
government," 5923 . Other liberties , however , do not derive from British precedents .","0"
government," The protections for religion , speech , the press , and assembly that are granted by the First Amendment did not exist under English law .","0"
government," ( The right to petition the government did , however . )","0"
government," 5926 . The Supreme Court , for example , has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right .","1"
government," The Tenth Amendment , one of the first submitted to the states for ratification , ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the Constitution .","1"
government," This guarantee protects states ’ reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage , divorce , and intrastate transportation and commerce , and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety .","0"
government," 5929 . In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .","0"
government," The Twenty - Second Amendment , added in 1955 , limits the president to two terms in office , and the Twenty - Seventh Amendment , first submitted for ratification in 1789 , regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of Congress .","1"
government," 5932 . When states began to change property requirements for voters in the 1830s , many that had allowed free , property - owning African American men to vote restricted the suffrage to white men .","0"
government," The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .","1"
government," After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .","1"
government," 5935 . The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .","1"
government," The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .","1"
government," Many southern states had used a poll tax , a tax placed on voting , to prevent poor African Americans from voting .","0"
government," 5938 . American federalism also seeks to balance the forces of decentralization and centralization .","0"
government," We see decentralization when we cross state lines and encounter different taxation levels , welfare eligibility requirements , and voting regulations , to name just a few .","0"
government," 5941 . In the United States , conflicts between states and the federal government are adjudicated by federal courts , with the U.S. Supreme Court being the final arbiter .","0"
government," The resolution of such disputes can preserve the autonomy of one level of government , as illustrated recently when the Supreme Court ruled that states can not interfere with the federal government ’s actions relating to immigration . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .","0"
government," In other instances , a Supreme Court ruling can erode that autonomy , as demonstrated in the 1940s when , in United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , the Court enabled the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states , a function previously handled exclusively by the states . United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , 315 U.S. 110 ( 1942 ) .","0"
government," 5944 . In a confederation , authority is decentralized , and the central government ’s ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments .","0"
government," Under the Articles of Confederation ( the first constitution of the United States ) , states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak .","1"
government," Because states were reluctant to give up any of their power , the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt , ending commercial disputes among states , negotiating trade agreements with other countries , and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country .","0"
government," 5947 . Cambridge , MA : Harvard University Press .","0"
government," However , when it came time to ratify the Constitution , a number of states requested that an amendment be added explicitly identifying the reserved powers of the states .","0"
government," What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .","0"
government," The Tenth Amendment affirms the states ’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”","0"
government," Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .","0"
government," 5950 . The most important restriction Section 9 places on the national government prevents measures that cause the deprivation of personal liberty .","0"
government," Specifically , the government can not suspend the writ of habeas corpus , which enables someone in custody to petition a judge to determine whether that person ’s detention is legal ; pass a bill of attainder , a legislative action declaring someone guilty without a trial ; or enact an ex post facto law , which criminalizes an act retroactively .","0"
government," The Bill of Rights affirms and expands these constitutional restrictions , ensuring that the government can not encroach on personal freedoms .","0"
government," 5953 . Various constitutional provisions govern state - to - state relations .","0"
government," Article IV , Section 1 , referred to as the full faith and credit clause or the comity clause , requires the states to accept court decisions , public acts , and contracts of other states .","0"
government," Thus , an adoption certificate or driver ’s license issued in one state is valid in any other state .","0"
government," 5956 . Scores of states considered legislation and ballot initiatives on the question .","0"
government," The federal courts took up the issue with zeal after the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor struck down the part of DOMA that outlawed federal benefits . United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .","0"
government," That move was followed by upwards of forty federal court decisions that upheld marriage equality in particular states .","0"
government," In 2014 , the Supreme Court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states , all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts .","0"
government," 5959 . State and local government figures are estimated .","0"
government," Two important developments have fundamentally changed the allocation of revenue since the early 1900s .","0"
government," First , the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 authorized Congress to impose income taxes without apportioning it among the states on the basis of population , a burdensome provision that Article I , Section 9 , had imposed on the national government . Pollock v. Farmers ’ Loan & Trust Co. , 158 U.S. 601 ( 1895 ) .","0"
government," With this change , the federal government ’s ability to raise revenue significantly increased and so did its ability to spend .","0"
government," The second development regulates federal grants , that is , transfers of federal money to state and local governments .","0"
government," These transfers , which do not have to be repaid , are designed to support the activities of the recipient governments , but also to encourage them to pursue federal policy objectives they might not otherwise adopt .","0"
government," 5962 . In 2009 , President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) , which provided immediate economic - crisis management assistance such as helping local and state economies ride out the Great Recession and shoring up the country ’s banking sector .","1"

government," In McCulloch v. Maryland , Chief Justice John Marshall ( [ link ] ) argued that Congress could create a national bank even though the Constitution did not expressly authorize it . McCulloch v. Maryland , 17 U.S. 316 ( 1819 ) .","0"
government," Under the necessary and proper clause of Article I , Section 8 , the Supreme Court asserted that Congress could establish “ all means which are appropriate ” to fulfill “ the legitimate ends ” of the Constitution .","0"
government," In other words , the bank was an appropriate instrument that enabled the national government to carry out several of its enumerated powers , such as regulating interstate commerce , collecting taxes , and borrowing money .","0"
government," 5971 . Gibbons lost in New York state courts and appealed .","0"
government," Chief Justice Marshall delivered a two - part ruling in favor of Gibbons that strengthened the power of the national government .","0"
government," First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .","0"
government," 5974 . When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798 , which made it a crime to speak openly against the government , the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws .","1"
government," In effect , these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification — that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional .","0"
government," W . Kirk Wood .","0"
government," 5977 . South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .","0"
government," The federal government responded by enacting the Force Bill in 1833 , authorizing President Jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws .","0"
government," The prospect of military action coupled with the passage of the Compromise Tariff Act of 1833 ( which lowered tariffs over time ) led South Carolina to back off , ending the nullification crisis .","0"
government," 5980 . The ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the Civil War .","0"
government," Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .","0"
government," But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .","0"
government," What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .","0"
government," 5983 . Second , Congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former Confederate states into the Union ; among them was ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .","0"
government," In sum , after the Civil War the power balance shifted toward the national government , a movement that had begun several decades before with McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) and Gibbons v. Odgen ( 1824 ) .","0"
government," 5986 . New York : Routledge .","0"
government," To curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry , Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 , which created the Interstate Commerce Commission .","1"
government," Three years later , national regulatory capacity was broadened by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce ( Figure 03_02_Commerce ) .","1"
government," In the early stages of industrial capitalism , federal regulations were focused for the most part on promoting market competition rather than on addressing the social dislocations resulting from market operations , something the government began to tackle in the 1930s . Eisner , The American Political Economy ; Stephen Skowronek .","0"
government," 5989 . For example , New York State passed the Bakeshop Act in 1897 , which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week .","1"
government," In Lochner v. New York , the Supreme Court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional , on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 ( 1905 ) .","0"
government," In other words , the right to sell and buy labor is a “ liberty of the individual ” safeguarded by the Constitution , the court asserted .","0"
government," The federal government also took up the issue of working conditions , but that case resulted in the same outcome as in the Lochner case .","0"
government," Hammer v. Dagenhart , 247 U.S. 251 ( 1918 ) .","0"
government," 5992 . The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .","0"
government," The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .","0"
government," 5995 . In National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) v. Jones and Laughlin Steel , National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) v. Jones & Laughlin Steel , 301 U.S. 1 ( 1937 ) .","0"
government," for instance , the Supreme Court ruled the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 constitutional , asserting that Congress can use its authority under the commerce clause to regulate both manufacturing activities and labor - management relations .","1"
government," The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .","0"
government," 5998 . In the 1960s , President Lyndon Johnson ’s administration expanded the national government ’s role in society even more .","0"
government," Medicaid ( which provides medical assistance to the indigent ) , Medicare ( which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled ) , and school nutrition programs were created .","1"
government," The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ( 1965 ) , the Higher Education Act ( 1965 ) , and the Head Start preschool program ( 1965 ) were established to expand educational opportunities and equality ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," 6001 . Finally , laws were passed to promote urban renewal , public housing development , and affordable housing .","0"
government," In addition to these Great Society programs , the Civil Rights Act ( 1964 ) and the Voting Rights Act ( 1965 ) gave the federal government effective tools to promote civil rights equality across the country .","0"
government," 6004 . During the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon ( 1969 – 1974 ) and Ronald Reagan ( 1981 – 1989 ) , attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization — that is , to restore states ’ prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past .","0"
government," New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .","0"
government," During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .","0"
government," 6007 . Several Supreme Court rulings also promoted new federalism by hemming in the scope of the national government ’s power , especially under the commerce clause .","0"
government," For example , in United States v. Lopez , the court struck down the Gun - Free School Zones Act of 1990 , which banned gun possession in school zones . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .","1"
government," It argued that the regulation in question did not “ substantively affect interstate commerce . ”","0"
government," The ruling ended a nearly sixty - year period in which the court had used a broad interpretation of the commerce clause that by the 1960s allowed it to regulate numerous local commercial activities .","0"
government," See Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898 ( 1997 ) .","0"
government," 6010 . Morton Grodzins coined the cake analogy of federalism in the 1950s while conducting research on the evolution of American federalism .","0"
government," Until then most scholars had thought of federalism as a layer cake , but according to Grodzins the 1930s ushered in “ marble - cake federalism ” ( [ link ] ) : “","1"
government," The American form of government is often , but erroneously , symbolized by a three - layer cake .","1"
government," 6013 . Medicaid and the food stamp program are examples of categorical grants .","0"
government," Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .","1"
government," Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .","0"
government," 6016 . President Clinton vetoed the legislation .","0"
government," However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .","0"
government," The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .","1"
government," 6019 . Unfunded mandates are federal laws and regulations that impose obligations on state and local governments without fully compensating them for the administrative costs they incur .","1"
government," The federal government has used mandates increasingly since the 1960s to promote national objectives in policy areas such as the environment , civil rights , education , and homeland security .","0"
government," 6022 . The widespread use of federal mandates in the 1970s and 1980s provoked a backlash among state and local authorities , which culminated in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act ( UMRA ) in 1995 .","0"
government," The UMRA ’s main objective has been to restrain the national government ’s use of mandates by subjecting rules that impose unfunded requirements on state and local governments to greater procedural scrutiny .","0"

government," The court struck down three of the four central provisions of the Arizona law — namely , those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think he or she had committed a crime that could lead to deportation , making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration papers , and making it a crime to be in Arizona without valid immigration papers .","0"

government," Because of the Constitution ’s civil rights guarantee , it is unlawful for a school or university run by a state government to treat students differently based on their race , ethnicity , age , sex , or national origin .","0"
government," 6055 . The Constitution as written in 1787 did not include a Bill of Rights , although the idea of including one was proposed and , after brief discussion , dismissed in the final week of the Constitutional Convention .","0"
government," The framers of the Constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties , most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats .","0"
government," 6058 . Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes .","0"
government," An ex post facto law has a retroactive effect : it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed , or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact .","0"
government," 6061 . Debate has always swirled over these issues .","0"
government," The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .","0"
government," Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No .","0"
government," 6064 . However , the Anti - Federalists argued that the Federalists ’ position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere .","0"
government," The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .","0"
government," 6067 . In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .","0"
government," In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .","1"
government," Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”","0"
government," 6070 . In the short term , they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted the black codes .","0"
government," Their long - term solution was to propose two amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites ; these rights became the Fourteenth Amendment , which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general , and the Fifteenth Amendment , which protected the right to vote in particular ( [ link ] ) .","1"
government," But , the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to Native Americans .","0"
government," 6073 . With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , civil liberties gained more clarification .","0"
government," First , the amendment says , “ no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States , ” which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV , Section 2 , of the original Constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens .","0"
government," ( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .","0"
government," 6076 . Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .","0"
government," For example , in Sherbert v. Verner ( 1963 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the Sabbath .","0"
government," Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) .","0"
government," 6079 . When the Supreme Court initially decided in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well .","0"
government," It was only in the McDonald v. Chicago case two years later that the Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment into state law .","0"
government," Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .","0"
government," 6082 . The First Amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the Bill of Rights ; it is arguably also the most extensive , because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public .","0"
government," Specifically , the First Amendment says :","0"
government," 6085 . The key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing , in Thomas Jefferson ’s words , “ a wall of separation between church and state . ” In a 1971 case known as Lemon v. Kurtzman , the Supreme Court established the Lemon test for deciding whether a law or other government action that might promote a particular religious practice should be allowed to stand . Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) .","0"
government," The Lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such a law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect :","0"
government," 6088 . The rights of conscientious objectors — individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought , conscience , or religion — have also been controversial , although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non - combatant medics during wartime .","0"
government," To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .","0"
government," 6091 . In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .","0"
government," It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ”","0"
government," In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .","0"
government," This standard became known as the Sherbert test .","0"
government," Since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government , the Supreme Court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs .","0"
government," 6094 . Such a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby .","0"
government," Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .","0"
government," The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores ; its founder , David Green , is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception .","0"
government," Consistent with these beliefs , he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) requiring employer - backed insurance plans to include no - charge access to the morning - after pill , a form of emergency contraception , arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience .","0"
government," 6097 . Although the remainder of the First Amendment protects four distinct rights — free speech , press , assembly , and petition — we generally think of these rights today as encompassing a right to freedom of expression , particularly since the world ’s technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication ( i.e. , speech and press ) in the centuries since the First Amendment was written and adopted .","0"
government," 6100 . One such person was Gregory Lee Johnson , a member of various pro - communist and antiwar groups .","0"
government," In 1984 , as part of a protest near the Republican National Convention in Dallas , Texas , Johnson set fire to a U.S. flag that another protestor had torn from a flagpole .","0"
government," 6103 . Freedom of the press is an important component of the right to free expression as well .","0"
government," In Near v. Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .","0"
government," This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers .","0"
government," New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 ( 1971 ) .","0"
government," These papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War that had been compiled by the military .","0"
government," More specifically , the papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 .","0"
government," 6106 . Although people who leak secret information to the media can still be prosecuted and punished , this does not generally extend to reporters and news outlets that pass that information on to the public .","0"
government," The Edward Snowden case is another good case in point .","0"
government," Snowden himself , rather than those involved in promoting the information that he shared , is the object of criminal prosecution .","0"
government," 6109 . Another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity , acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards .","0"
government," Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ”","0"
government," Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .","0"
government," In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value .","0"
government," ” Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .","0"
government," However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .","0"
government," 6112 . Furthermore , the courts have ruled that , although public school officials are government actors , the First Amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited .","0"
government," In particular , in Tinker v. Des Moines ( 1969 ) and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier ( 1988 ) , the Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates “ substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others ”","0"
government," Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District , 393 U.S. 503 ( 1969 ) .","0"
government," or is “ reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns .","0"
government," ” Hazelwood School District et al. v. Kuhlmeier et al. , 484 U.S. 260 ( 1988 ) .","0"
government," For example , the content of school - sponsored activities like school newspapers and speeches delivered by students can be controlled , either for the purposes of instructing students in proper adult behavior or to deter conflict between students .","0"
government," 6115 . Before the Civil War , this would have been a nearly meaningless distinction .","0"
government," In most states at that time , white males of military age were considered part of the militia , liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions , and the right “ to keep and bear Arms ” was considered a common - law right inherited from English law that predated the federal and state constitutions .","0"
government," The Constitution was not seen as a limitation on state power , and since the states expected all able - bodied free men to keep arms as a matter of course , what gun control there was mostly revolved around ensuring slaves ( and their abolitionist allies ) did n’t have guns .","0"
government," 6118 . However , in 2008 , in a narrow 5 – 4 decision on District of Columbia v. Heller , the Supreme Court found that at least some gun control laws did violate the Second Amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , at least in some circumstances — in particular , “ for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home . ”","0"
government," District of Columbia et al. v. Heller , 554 US 570 ( 2008 ) , p. 3 .","0"
government," Because the District of Columbia is not a state , this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments .","0"
government," 6121 . The Fourth Amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes .","0"
government," We saw earlier that perhaps it reflects James Madison ’s broader concern about establishing an expectation of privacy from government intrusion at home .","0"
government," 6124 . What happens if the police conduct an illegal search or seizure without a warrant and find evidence of a crime ?","0"
government," In the 1961 Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio , the court decided that evidence obtained without a warrant that did n’t fall under one of the exceptions mentioned above could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial , giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the exclusionary rule , which was first established in 1914 on a federal level in Weeks v. United States .","0"
government," Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 ( 1961 ) ; Weeks v. United States , 232 U.S. 383 ( 1914 ) .","0"
government," The exclusionary rule does n’t just apply to evidence found or to items or people seized without a warrant ( or falling under an exception noted above ) ; it also applies to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or seizure .","0"
government," 6127 . The Fifth Amendment also protects individuals against double jeopardy , a process that subjects a suspect to prosecution twice for the same criminal act .","0"
government," No one who has been acquitted ( found not guilty ) of a crime can be prosecuted again for that crime .","0"
government," 6130 . Moreover , in a criminal trial , if someone does not testify in his or her own defense , the prosecution can not use that failure to testify as evidence of guilt or imply that an innocent person would testify .","0"
government," This provision became embedded in the public consciousness following the Supreme Court ’s 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona , whereby suspects were required to be informed of their most important rights , including the right against self - incrimination , before being interrogated in police custody .","1"
government," Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) .","0"
government," However , contrary to some media depictions of the Miranda warning , law enforcement officials do not necessarily have to inform suspects of their rights before they are questioned in situations where they are free to leave .","0"
government," 6133 . And , while we traditionally think of property owners as relatively well - off people whose rights do n’t necessarily need protecting since they can fend for themselves in the political system , frequently these cases pit lower- and middle - class homeowners against multinational corporations or multimillionaires with the ear of city and state officials .","0"
government," In a notorious 2005 case , Kelo v. City of New London , the Supreme Court sided with municipal officials taking homes in a middle - class neighborhood to obtain land for a large pharmaceutical company ’s corporate campus .","1"
government," Kelo et al. v. City of New London et al . , 545 U.S. 469 ( 2005 ) .","0"
government," The case led to a public backlash against the use of eminent domain and legal changes in many states , making it harder for cities to take property from one private party and give it to another for economic redevelopment purposes .","0"
government," 6139 . Bail is a payment of money that allows a person accused of a crime to be freed pending trial ; if you “ make bail ” in a case and do not show up for your trial , you will forfeit the money you paid .","1"
government," Since many people can not afford to pay bail directly , they may instead get a bail bond , which allows them to pay a fraction of the money ( typically 10 percent ) to a person who sells bonds and who pays the full bail amount .","1"
government," ( In most states , the bond seller makes money because the defendant does not get back the money for the bond , and most people show up for their trials . )","0"
government," 6142 . As this chapter has suggested , the provisions of the Bill of Rights have been interpreted and reinterpreted repeatedly over the past two centuries .","0"
government," However , the first eight amendments are largely silent on the status of traditional common law , which was the legal basis for many of the natural rights claimed by the framers in the Declaration of Independence .","0"
government," 6145 . Unlike the other provisions of the Bill of Rights , this amendment focuses on power rather than rights .","0"
government," The courts have generally read the Tenth Amendment as merely stating , as Chief Justice Harlan Stone put it , a “ truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered . ”","0"
government," United States v. Darby Lumber , 312 U.S. 100 ( 1941 ) .","0"
government," In other words , rather than limiting the power of the federal government in any meaningful way , it simply restates what is made obvious elsewhere in the Constitution : the federal government has both enumerated and implied powers , but where the federal government does not ( or chooses not to ) exercise power , the states may do so .","0"
government," 6148 . The legal landscape changed dramatically as a result of the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade , Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .","0"
government," in which the Supreme Court decided the right to privacy encompassed a right for women to terminate a pregnancy , at least under certain scenarios .","1"
government," The justices ruled that while the government did have an interest in protecting the “ potentiality of human life , ” nonetheless this had to be balanced against the interests of both women ’s health and women ’s right to decide whether to have an abortion .","0"
government," 6151 . In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .","0"
government," Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .","0"
government," 6154 . We can contrast civil rights with civil liberties , which are limitations on government power designed to protect our fundamental freedoms .","1"
government," For example , the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of “ cruel and unusual punishments ” to those convicted of crimes , a limitation on government power .","0"
government," 6157 . Discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny .","0"
government," The standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren ( 1976 ) and again in Clark v. Jeter ( 1988 ) .","0"
government," Craig v. Boren , 429 U.S. 190 ( 1976 ) ; Clark v. Jeter , 486 U.S. 456 ( 1988 ) .","0"
government," It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective . ”","0"
government," This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable , not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place .","0"
government," In practice , this means laws that treat men and women differently are sometimes upheld , although usually they are not .","0"
government," 6160 . The Republican majority in Congress was enraged by the actions of the reconstituted governments of the southern states .","0"
government," In these states , many former Confederate politicians and their sympathizers returned to power and attempted to circumvent the Thirteenth Amendment ’s freeing of slaves by passing laws known as the black codes .","0"
government," These laws were designed to reduce former slaves to the status of serfs or indentured servants ; blacks were not just denied the right to vote but also could be arrested and jailed for vagrancy or idleness if they lacked jobs .","1"
government," 6163 . One way to get involved in the fight for civil rights is to stay informed .","0"
government," The Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) is a not - for - profit advocacy group based in Montgomery , Alabama .","1"
government," Lawyers for the SPLC specialize in civil rights litigation and represent many people whose rights have been violated , from victims of hate crimes to undocumented immigrants .","0"
government," 6169 . At the end of the Civil War , the South entered a period called Reconstruction ( 1865 – 1877 ) during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the Union .","1"
government," As part of this process , the Republican Party pushed for a permanent end to slavery .","0"
government," 6172 . The Fifteenth Amendment stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on “ race , color , or previous condition of servitude . ”","1"
government," This construction allowed states to continue to decide the qualifications of voters as long as those qualifications were ostensibly race - neutral .","0"
government," Thus , while states could not deny African American men the right to vote on the basis of race , they could deny it to women on the basis of sex or to people who could not prove they were literate .","0"
government," 6178 . Similarly , state and local governments passed laws limiting what neighborhoods blacks and whites could live in .","0"
government," Collectively , these discriminatory laws came to be known as Jim Crow laws .","0"
government," The Supreme Court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson , consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment ’s equal protection clause , and allowed segregation to continue .","0"
government," Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 ( 1896 ) .","0"

government," Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) .","0"
government," In this case , the Supreme Court unanimously overturned its decision in Plessy v. Ferguson as it pertained to public education , stating that a separate but equal education was a logical impossibility .","0"
government," Even with the same funding and equivalent facilities , a segregated school could not have the same teachers or environment as the equivalent school for another race .","0"

government," These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches , including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations .","0"
government," 6193 . Civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the 1955 – 1956 Montgomery bus boycott .","0"
government," After Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white person and was arrested , a group of black women carried out a day - long boycott of Montgomery ’s public transit system .","0"
government," This boycott was then extended for over a year and overseen by union organizer E. D. Nixon .","0"

government," Progress in registering African American voters remained slow in many states despite increased federal activity supporting it , so civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King , Jr. decided to draw the public eye to the area where the greatest resistance to voter registration drives were taking place .","0"
government," The SCLC and SNCC particularly focused their attention on the city of Selma , Alabama , which had been the site of violent reactions against civil rights activities .","0"
government," 6202 . Martin Luther King , Jr. ( left ) and Malcolm X ( right ) adopted different approaches to securing civil rights for African Americans .","0"
government," This occasion , a Senate debate of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , was the only time the two men ever met .","0"

government," 6457 . This raises the question of how the media , even general newscasts , can affect citizens .","0"
government," One of the ways is through framing : the creation of a narrative , or context , for a news story .","0"
government," The news often uses frames to place a story in a context so the reader understands its importance or relevance .","0"
government," 6460 . This study supports the argument that shrinking sound bites are a way for journalists to control the story and add their own analysis rather than just report on it .","0"

government," Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .","1"
government," For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .","0"
government," 6472 . After the election is over , supporters experience remorse when their least - favorite candidate wins instead .","0"
government," For example , in the 2000 election , Ralph Nader ran for president as the candidate of the Green Party .","0"
government," Nader , a longtime consumer activist concerned with environmental issues and social justice , attracted many votes from people who usually voted for Democratic candidates .","0"
government," 6475 . Electoral rules are probably not the only reason the United States has a two - party system .","0"
government," We need only look at the number of parties in the British or Canadian systems , both of which are winner - take - all plurality systems like that in the United States , to see that it is possible to have more than two parties while still directly electing representatives .","0"
government," 6478 . For example , people who describe themselves as evangelical Christians are an important Republican constituency ; they are also strongly opposed to abortion . Aaron Blake , “ The Ten Most Loyal Demographic Groups for Republicans and Democrats , ” The Washington Post , 8 April 2015 .","0"
government," Thus , even though the majority of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances , such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or threatens the life of the mother , the position of many Republican presidential candidates in 2016 was to oppose abortion in all cases . Irin Carmon , “ GOP Candidates : Ban Abortion , No Exceptions , ” 7 August 2015 , http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-candidates-ban-abortion-no-exceptions ( March 14 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," As a result , many women view the Republican Party as unsympathetic to their interests and are more likely to support Democratic candidates .

government," Key .","0"
government," 6481 . That change began with the 1932 presidential campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt .","0"
government," FDR determined that his best path toward victory was to create a new coalition based not on region or ethnicity , but on the suffering of those hurt the most during the Great Depression .","0"
government," 6484 . At its most basic level , being a member of the party - in - the - electorate simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party .","0"
government," These voters are often called party identifiers , since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party , and they may attend some party events or functions .","0"
government," Party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season .","0"
government," 6487 . Second , the state organization is also responsible for drafting a state platform that serves as a policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office .","0"
government," These platforms are usually the result of a negotiation between the various coalitions within the party and are designed to ensure that everyone in the party will receive some benefits if their candidates win the election .","0"
government," 6490 . This has been particularly true for the Democratic Party .","0"
government," In 1988 , the Democrats tapped Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to introduce their nominee Michael Dukakis at the convention .","0"
government," Clinton ’s speech was lampooned for its length and lack of focus , but it served to get his name in front of Democratic voters .","0"
government," 6493 . If the issue is important enough to voters , as in the case of gun control or abortion rights , an office holder may feel his or her job will be in jeopardy if he or she too closely follows the party line , even if that means disagreeing with the executive .","0"
government," A good example occurred when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which desegregated public accommodations and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , was introduced in Congress .","0"
government," The bill was supported by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , both of whom were Democrats .","0"
government," 6496 . The problem of majority versus minority politics is particularly acute under conditions of divided government .","0"
government," Divided government occurs when one or more houses of the legislature are controlled by the party in opposition to the executive .","1"
government," 6499 . Recently , however , a new voice has emerged that has allied itself with the Republican Party .","0"
government," Born in part from an older third - party movement known as the Libertarian Party , the Tea Party is more hostile to government and views government intervention in all forms , and especially taxation and the regulation of business , as a threat to capitalism and democracy .","0"
government," It is less willing to tolerate interventions in the market place , even when they are designed to protect the markets themselves .","0"
government," 6502 . Scholars agree that some degree of polarization is occurring in the United States , even if some contend it is only at the elite level .","0"
government," But they are less certain about exactly why , or how , polarization has become such a mainstay of American politics .","0"
government," 6505 . The first advance came with the introduction of the “ one - person - one - vote ” principle by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 .","0"
government," Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .","0"
government," This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .","0"
government," 6508 . Several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles ( 1970–1972 and 1980–1982 ) .","0"
government," Map designers , no longer certain how to protect individual party members , changed tactics to try and create safe seats so members of their party could be assured of winning by a comfortable margin .","0"
government," The basic rule of thumb was that designers sought to draw districts in which their preferred party had a 55 percent or better chance of winning a given district , regardless of which candidate the party nominated .","0"
government," 6511 . That is where political parties come in .","0"
government," Essentially , political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and implement policies .","1"
government," They do this by gaining control over the government by winning elections .","0"

government," The Federalist faction , led by Alexander Hamilton , largely dominated the government in the years immediately after the Constitution was ratified .","0"
government," Included in the Federalists was President George Washington , who was initially against the existence of parties in the United States .","0"
government," When Washington decided to exit politics and leave office , he warned of the potential negative effects of parties in his farewell address to the nation , including their potentially divisive nature and the fact that they might not always focus on the common good but rather on partisan ends .","0"
government," 6520 . In the election of 1824 , numerous candidates contended for the presidency , all members of the Democratic - Republican Party .","0"
government," Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .","0"
government," However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment .","1"
government," 6523 . One half , called simply the Democratic Party , was the party of Jackson ; it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank .","0"

government," Political parties that are formed as alternatives to the Republican and Democratic parties are known as third parties , or minor parties ( [ link ] ) .","1"
government," In 1892 , a third party known as the Populist Party formed in reaction to what its constituents perceived as the domination of U.S. society by big business and a decline in the power of farmers and rural communities .","0"
government," 6529 . Wallace ’s campaign was a failure , largely because most people believed his policies , including national healthcare , were too much like those of communism , and this party also vanished .","0"
government," The other third party , the States ’ Rights Democrats , also known as the Dixiecrats , were white , southern Democrats who split from the Democratic Party when Harry Truman , who favored civil rights for African Americans , became the party ’s nominee for president .","1"
government," The Dixiecrats opposed all attempts by the federal government to end segregation , extend voting rights , prohibit discrimination in employment , or otherwise promote social equality among races . “Platform of the States Rights Democratic Party , ” http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu / ws/?pid=25851 ( March 12 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," They remained a significant party that threatened Democratic unity throughout the 1950s and 1960s .","0"

government," 10 , James Madison warned of the dangers of “ factions , ” minorities who would organize around issues they felt strongly about , possibly to the detriment of the majority .","0"
government," But Madison believed limiting these factions was worse than facing the evils they might produce , because such limitations would violate individual freedoms .","0"
government," 6535 . Largely for this reason , there is no comprehensive list of all interest groups to tell us how many there are in the United States .","0"
government," Estimates of the number vary widely , suggesting that if we use a broad definition and include all interests at all levels of government , there may be more than 200,000.Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .","0"
government," Following the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act in 1995 , we had a much better understanding of the number of interests registered in Washington , DC ; however , it was not until several years later that we had a complete count and categorization of the interests registered in each of the fifty states .

government," 6538 . Governments such as municipalities and executive departments such as the Department of Education register to lobby in an effort to maximize their share of budgets or increase their level of autonomy .","0"
government," These government institutions are represented by a legislative liaison , whose job is to present issues to decision - makers .","0"
government," For example , a state university usually employs a lobbyist , legislative liaison , or government affairs person to represent its interests before the legislature .","0"

government," 1998 .","0"
government," 6544 . On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .","0"
government," Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .","0"
government," 6547 . The answer is that they likely prefer to do something else and realize they can receive the same grade as the rest of the group without contributing to the effort .","1"
government," This result is often termed the free rider problem , because some individuals can receive benefits ( get a free ride ) without helping to bear the cost .","1"
government," When National Public Radio ( NPR ) engages in a fund - raising effort to help maintain the station , many listeners will not contribute .","0"
government," 6550 . Similarly , purposive incentives focus on the issues or causes promoted by the group .","0"
government," Someone concerned about protecting individual rights might join a group like the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) because it supports the liberties guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution , even the free expression of unpopular views.https://www.aclu.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," Members of the ACLU sometimes find the messages of those they defend ( including Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan ) deplorable , but they argue that the principle of protecting civil liberties is critical to U.S. democracy .","0"

government," In 2014 , Ferguson , Missouri , erupted in protests and riots following a decision not to indict Darren Wilson , a white police officer , in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown , who had allegedly been involved in a theft at a local convenience store and ended up in a dispute with the officer . “Hundreds of Ferguson Protesters March in Downtown D.C. , ” http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ferguson-Protests-Planned-for-DC-Baltimore-Tuesday-283807831.html ( March 1 , 2016 ) .","0"
government," The incident mobilized groups representing civil rights , such as the protestors in [ link ] , as well as others supporting the interests of police officers .","0"
government," 6556 . Individually , the protestors would likely have received little notice , but by joining with others , they drew substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers ( [ link ] ) .","0"
government," While the Tea Party movement might not meet the definition of interest groups presented earlier , its aims have been promoted by established interest groups .","0"
government," Other opportunities for participation that interest groups offer or encourage include voting , campaigning , contacting lawmakers , and informing the public about causes .","0"

government," A prominent lobbyist with ties to many of the Republican members of Congress , Abramoff used funds provided by his clients to fund reelection campaigns , pay for trips , and hire the spouses of members of Congress .","0"
government," 6580 . Large states , like Virginia , felt it would be unfair to continue with this style of legislative institution .","0"
government," As a result , Virginia ’s delegates proposed a plan that called for bicameralism , or the division of legislators into two separate assemblies .","1"
government," In this proposed two - chamber Congress , states with larger populations would have more representatives in each chamber .","0"
government," 6583 . The bicameral system established at the Constitutional Convention and still followed today requires the two houses to pass identical bills , or proposed items of legislation .","0"
government," This ensures that after all amending and modifying has occurred , the two houses ultimately reach an agreement about the legislation they send to the president .","0"
government," 6586 . Attempts at African American disenfranchisement continued until the civil rights struggle of the 1960s finally brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .","0"
government," The act cleared several final hurdles to voter registration and voting for African Americans .","0"

government," An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .","1"
government," And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .","1"
government," 6592 . These include Congress ’s sole power to introduce legislation , the Senate ’s final say on many presidential nominations and treaties signed by the president , and the House ’s ability to impeach or formally accuse the president or other federal officials of wrongdoing ( the first step in removing the person from office ; the second step , trial and removal , takes place in the U.S. Senate ) .","0"
government," Each of these powers also grants Congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch .","0"
government," The fact that Congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce .","0"
government," 6595 . In the early days of the republic , Congress ’s role was rarely if ever disputed .","0"
government," However , with its decision in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court asserted its authority over judicial review and assumed the power to declare laws unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) .","1"
government," Yet , even after that decision , the Court was reluctant to use this power and did n’t do so for over half a century .","0"
government," Initially , the presidency was also a fairly weak branch of government compared with the legislature .","0"
government," 6598 . His popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow Congress .","0"
government," As a result , Congress attempted to restrain the power of the presidency by proposing the Twenty - Second Amendment to the Constitution , which limited a president to only two full terms in office . David M. Jordan .","0"
government," 2011 .","0"
government," 6601 . Another handful of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of World War II , but then Congress neglected campaign finance reform for a few decades .","0"
government," That lull ended in the early 1970s when the Federal Election Campaign Act was passed .","0"
government," Among other things , it created the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , required candidates to disclose where their money was coming from and where they were spending it , limited individual contributions , and provided for public financing of presidential campaigns .","0"
government," 6604 . In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .","0"
government," A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .","0"
government," 6607 . Political scientists have taken note of some voting patterns that appear to challenge this common assumption , however .","0"
government," In 1960 , political scientist Angus Campbell proposed the surge - and - decline theory to explain these patterns . Angus Campbell .","0"
government," 1960 .","0"
government," 6610 . These are generally referred to as the majority and minority leaders .","0"
government," The minority leader has a visible if not always a powerful position .","0"
government," As the official leader of the opposition , he or she technically holds the rank closest to that of the Speaker , makes strategy decisions , and attempts to keep order within the minority .","0"
government," 6613 . Apart from this and very few other exceptions , the president of the Senate does not actually operate in the Senate .","0"
government," Instead , the Constitution allows for the Senate to choose a president pro tempore — usually the most senior senator of the majority party — who presides over the Senate .","0"
government," Despite the title , the job is largely a formal and powerless role .","0"
government," 6616 . However , joint committees have no bill - referral authority whatsoever — they are informational only .","0"
government," A conference committee is used to reconcile different bills passed in both the House and the Senate .","1"
government," The conference committees are appointed on an ad hoc basis as necessary when a bill passes the House and Senate in different forms .","0"
government," 6619 . Once legislation has been proposed , however , the majority leadership consults with the parliamentarian about which committee to send it to .","0"
government," Each chamber has a parliamentarian , an advisor , typically a trained lawyer , who has studied the long and complex rules of the chamber .","1"
government," 6622 . After the Civil War , the use of the filibuster became even more common .","0"
government," Eventually , in 1917 , the Senate passed Rule 22 , which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate .","0"
government," To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .","0"

government," This and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in Congress of the utility of this strategy .","0"
government," 6631 . Therefore , they ( and their staff members ) rely on interest groups and lobbyists to provide them with information about the technical details of policy proposals , as well as about fellow lawmakers ’ stands and constituents ’ perceptions .","0"

government," In it , members of Congress act as either trustee or delegate based on rational political calculations about who is best served , the constituency or the nation .","1"
government," 6640 . Many advances in women ’s rights have been the result of women ’s greater engagement in politics and representation in the halls of government , especially since the founding of the National Organization for Women in 1966 and the National Women ’s Political Caucus ( NWPC ) in 1971 .","0"
government," The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .","0"

government," He or she becomes the spokesperson for the entire state and their political party , accepts blame or praise for handling decision - making in times of crisis , oversees the implementation of public policy , and helps shepherd legislation through the lawmaking process .","0"
government," 6874 . Having introduced his or her priorities , the governor will work on the sidelines to steer favored bills through the legislative process .","0"

government," 6934 . Agencies formed by the federal government to administer a quasi - business enterprise are called government corporations .","1"
government," They exist because the services they provide are partly subject to market forces and tend to generate enough profit to be self - sustaining , but they also fulfill a vital service the government has an interest in maintaining .","0"
government," 6937 . Once the particulars of implementation have been spelled out in the legislation authorizing a new program , bureaucracies move to enact it .","0"
government," When they encounter grey areas , many follow the federal negotiated rulemaking process to propose a solution , that is , detailing how particular new federal polices , regulations , and/or programs will be implemented in the agencies .","0"
government," Congress can not possibly legislate on that level of detail , so the experts in the bureaucracy do so .","0"

government," One of the basic principles of free - market economics is that for just about any good that can be privatized , the most efficient means for exchange is the marketplace .","0"
government," 6958 . Economists consider goods like cable TV , cellphone service , and private schools to be toll goods .","0"
government," Toll goods are similar to public goods in that they are open to all and theoretically infinite if maintained , but they are paid for or provided by some outside ( nongovernment ) entity .","1"

government," Rather than starting with what ought to happen and seeking ways to make it so , policy analysts try to identify all the possible choices available to a decision maker and then gauge their impacts if implemented .","0"
government," The goal of the analyst is n’t really to encourage the implementation of any of the options ; rather , it is to make sure decision makers are fully informed about the implications of the decisions they do make .","0"
